== How to Play the Game

====
*Commentary*

This Section serves as an orientation for the prospective player (or rules reader), providing a basic overview of what is involved in the game and how it is organized.

=== Organization of the Rules and How They Should Be Read

<<2_0,2.0>> is divided into three parts. The second part discusses how the game is set up. The third part explains how the game is actually played. Everything is explained in very general terms; the intention is to orient the reader rather than to teach detailed procedures.

<<3_0,3.0>> is a glossary intended to explain terms used during play and their relationships to one another. The glossary should be reviewed before the rest of the rules, although some definitions will not become fully clear until the relevant sections are read.

<<4_0,4.0>> describes the game equipment and details how the game should be set up.

<<5_0,5.0>> contains the *Sequence of Play*, which outlines a single Game-Turn. <<1_0,1.0>> through <<5_0,5.0>> are written to familiarize the player with game terms and the overall system of play.

<<6_0,6.0>> through <<32_0,32.0>> include all rules necessary to play the *Land Game*. The Land Game uses abstracted and relatively simple supply rules and very simple air power rules.

<<33_0,33.0>> through <<47_0,47.0>> encompass the *Air Game*, which involves individual aircraft and pilots and the effects of their presence.

<<48_0,48.0>> through <<58_0,58.0>> constitute the *Logistics Game*, which replaces the abstract supply rules used if the Land Game is played alone. It is possible to play the Land Game by itself, to combine the Land and Air Games, or to combine the Logistics Game with either or both of the other games.

<<59_0,59.0>> through <<65_0,65.0>> describe the five *Scenario Groups*. One Scenario is the full Campaign Game, covering the entire campaign from September 1940 (the Italian invasion of Egypt) onward. Other Scenarios are smaller slices of the campaign that can be played to a decision in considerably less time.

=== How the Game Is Set Up

There are two basic and vital prerequisites for playing CNA: *time* and *people*.

Preparing to play CNA requires considerable effort, both in preparing the game
components and in planning strategies and organizing a workable division of
labor and logistics system.

Unlike many other SPI games, the counters on the map do not contain all the
information required to play. Players must keep track, on paper, of many details
concerning the status of their units, including (but not limited to) current
strength, attached subsidiary units, morale level, supply status, water, fuel,
ammunition, and stores.

Setting up the game involves compiling information for each unit required by the
Scenario. Provided with the game are three TOE Log Sheets designed to store this
information. Each type of Log Sheet corresponds to a specific type or size of
unit. Players will need to create additional Log Sheets by copying or designing
their own. One Log Sheet is required for each counter on the map.

Players should also ensure they have plenty of pencils (with erasers), scratch paper, and stamina.

=== How to Run a Game of CNA

CNA is a logistically oriented game and requires not only attention to logistics
but also a logistically sound methodology of play.

Playtesting indicates that the optimal number of players is eight to ten—four to
five per side. Fewer than four creates excessive workload; more than five slows
decision-making.

Clear division of responsibilities is critical. Teams that communicate
effectively consistently outperform technically proficient but poorly
coordinated teams. The standard division of responsibilities is:

*Commander-in-Chief*:: Overall intelligence and dissemination of information; strategic decisions; resolving disputes; planning raids and special actions.
*Logistics Commander*:: All supplies; transport from Italy or Britain to North Africa; supply dumps; Third-Line Trucks; some Second-Line Trucks; naval convoys (Axis).
*Rear Area Commander*:: Supply and reinforcements to the front; rear-area security; reserves; prisoners; construction; some Second-Line Trucks.
*Air Commander*:: Aircraft and pilots; planning and execution of air missions; deployment of air bases.
*Front-Line Commander*:: Execution of attacks; coordination of defenses; front-line troop movement.

For effective play, each commander must perform competently and communicate clearly. Failures in coordination can quickly lead to disaster.

=== Playing Time

Playing the entire *Campaign for North Africa* requires at least 1,200 hours of
play time, likely more. Each Game-Turn takes approximately ten hours, although
less time may be required during turns with limited movement or combat. This is
a long game. Individual Game-Turns may occasionally be completed in two hours,
but such speed usually occurs only when both sides are logistically exhausted.
The length of play is deliberate: the level of involvement allows players to
make virtually all of the operational and strategic decisions that the original
commanders were required to make.
