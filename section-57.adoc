== COMMONWEALTH
SUPPLY BASE

GENERAL RULE:

The Commonwealth Player has an unlimited
amount of supplies of all types — fuel, ammunition, water, and stores — in Cairo at all times during the game. His problem is solely to get it to
where he wants it. He does not ship supplies in; if
he wants something, it is in Cairo. Remember,
Commonwealth ships need no supplies. For reinforcements and replacements for personnel and
equipment, the Commonwealth Player should
consult his Reinforcement Schedule and CW
Replacement System (see Section <<20_0>>)
