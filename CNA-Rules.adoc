*Read This First*

The rules of this SPI simulation game are organized in a format known as the *Case System*. This system of organization divides the rules into *Major Sections* (each of which deals with an important aspect of play). These Sections are numbered sequentially as well as being named.

Each of these Major Sections is introduced by a *General Rule*, which briefly describes the subject of the Section. Many times this General Rule is followed by a *Procedure*, which describes the basic action the player will take when using the rules in that Section. Finally, the bulk of each Major Section consists of *Cases*. These are the specific detailed rules that actually regulate play.

Each of these Cases is also numbered. The numbering follows a logical system based upon the number of the Major Section of which the Cases are a part. A Case with the number `6.5`, for example, is the fifth Primary Case of the sixth Major Section of the rules. Many times these Primary Cases are further subdivided into *Secondary Cases*. A Secondary Case is recognizable by the fact that it has two digits to the right of its decimal point.

Each Major Section can have as many as nine Primary Cases, and each Primary Case can have as many as nine Secondary Cases. The numbering system is meant as an organizational aid. Using it, players can always easily tell where a Case is located in the rules. As a further aid, an outline of the Major Sections and Primary Cases is given at the beginning of the rules

*How the Section and Case Numbers Work*

* Major Section Number
* Primary Case Number
* Secondary Case Number

Example:

----
6.531
----

The preceding example would be the number of the third Secondary Case of the fifth Primary Case of the sixth Major Section of the rules.

*How to Learn to Play the Game*

Familiarize yourself with all of the components. Read all of the General Rules and Procedures and read the titles of the Primary Cases. Set up the game for play (after reading the pertinent Section) and play a trial game against yourself, referring to the rules only when you have a question.

This procedure may take you a few hours, but it is the fastest and most entertaining way to learn the rules short of having a friend teach them to you.

You should not attempt to learn the rules word-for-word. Memorizing all that detail is a task of which few of us are capable. SPI rules are written to be as complete as possible—they are not designed to be memorized. The Case numbering system makes it easy to look up rules when you are in doubt.

Absorbing the rules in this manner (as you play) is a much better approach to game mastery than attempting to study them as if cramming for a test.

We hope you enjoy this SPI game. Should you have any difficulty interpreting the rules, please write to SPI, phrasing your questions so that they can be answered by a simple sentence, word, or number. You must enclose a stamped, self-addressed envelope. We cannot guarantee a proper answer should you choose to phone in your question (the right person is not always available, and since SPI has published hundreds of games, no one individual is capable of answering all questions).

== Introduction

*The Campaign for North Africa* (CNA) is a simulation of actual operations in Libya and Egypt from 1940 through early 1943. CNA was designed as a definitive simulation intended for the sophisticated wargamer and the serious student of history. As such, CNA is the most logistically oriented game ever designed and may be considered by some to be overly complex.

In fact, the game system itself is quickly absorbed, and most experienced players will have little problem understanding how to play the game. At the same time, there is a ferocious amount of information for the players to digest and use. The assimilation and coordination of all this information is what makes CNA so formative, challenging, and (hopefully) enlightening. Very little has been abstracted; CNA contains more hard information on the subject than any other single source encountered by the SPI design staff.

CNA is not a game for one, two, or even three players. This is a multi-player game in the true sense of the word. For maximum playability and efficiency, it is recommended that, on each side, one person be assigned to Logistics, one person to Air Forces command, and at least three players to Land Forces command (again, per side). It is also strongly suggested that at least one calculator be available.

Although the rules are quite long, CNA is relatively easy to explain. Someone familiar with the rules can tell other players how to play with remarkable ease.

Each hex represents approximately eight kilometers; each Game-Turn represents one week of “real" time. Units range in size from companies (approximately 100 men) to divisions (approximately 15,000 men).

== How to Play the Game

====
*Commentary*

This Section serves as an orientation for the prospective player (or rules reader), providing a basic overview of what is involved in the game and how it is organized.
====

=== Organization of the Rules and How They Should Be Read

<<2_0>> is divided into three parts. The second part discusses how the game is set up. The third part explains how the game is actually played. Everything is explained in very general terms; the intention is to orient the reader rather than to teach detailed procedures.

<<3_0>> is a glossary intended to explain terms used during play and their relationships to one another. The glossary should be reviewed before the rest of the rules, although some definitions will not become fully clear until the relevant sections are read.

<<4_0>> describes the game equipment and details how the game should be set up.

<<5_0>> contains the *Sequence of Play*, which outlines a single Game-Turn. <<1_0>> through <<5_0>> are written to familiarize the player with game terms and the overall system of play.

<<6_0>> through <<32_0>> include all rules necessary to play the *Land Game*. The Land Game uses abstracted and relatively simple supply rules and very simple air power rules.

<<33_0>> through <<47_0>> encompass the *Air Game*, which involves individual aircraft and pilots and the effects of their presence.

<<48_0>> through <<58_0>> constitute the *Logistics Game*, which replaces the abstract supply rules used if the Land Game is played alone. It is possible to play the Land Game by itself, to combine the Land and Air Games, or to combine the Logistics Game with either or both of the other games.

<<59_0>> through <<65_0>> describe the five *Scenario Groups*. One Scenario is the full Campaign Game, covering the entire campaign from September 1940 (the Italian invasion of Egypt) onward. Other Scenarios are smaller slices of the campaign that can be played to a decision in considerably less time.

=== How the Game Is Set Up

There are two basic and vital prerequisites for playing CNA: *time* and *people*.

Preparing to play CNA requires considerable effort, both in preparing the game
components and in planning strategies and organizing a workable division of
labor and logistics system.

Unlike many other SPI games, the counters on the map do not contain all the
information required to play. Players must keep track, on paper, of many details
concerning the status of their units, including (but not limited to) current
strength, attached subsidiary units, morale level, supply status, water, fuel,
ammunition, and stores.

Setting up the game involves compiling information for each unit required by the
Scenario. Provided with the game are three TOE Log Sheets designed to store this
information. Each type of Log Sheet corresponds to a specific type or size of
unit. Players will need to create additional Log Sheets by copying or designing
their own. One Log Sheet is required for each counter on the map.

Players should also ensure they have plenty of pencils (with erasers), scratch paper, and stamina.

=== How to Run a Game of CNA

CNA is a logistically oriented game and requires not only attention to logistics
but also a logistically sound methodology of play.

Playtesting indicates that the optimal number of players is eight to ten—four to
five per side. Fewer than four creates excessive workload; more than five slows
decision-making.

Clear division of responsibilities is critical. Teams that communicate
effectively consistently outperform technically proficient but poorly
coordinated teams. The standard division of responsibilities is:

*Commander-in-Chief*:: Overall intelligence and dissemination of information; strategic decisions; resolving disputes; planning raids and special actions.
*Logistics Commander*:: All supplies; transport from Italy or Britain to North Africa; supply dumps; Third-Line Trucks; some Second-Line Trucks; naval convoys (Axis).
*Rear Area Commander*:: Supply and reinforcements to the front; rear-area security; reserves; prisoners; construction; some Second-Line Trucks.
*Air Commander*:: Aircraft and pilots; planning and execution of air missions; deployment of air bases.
*Front-Line Commander*:: Execution of attacks; coordination of defenses; front-line troop movement.

For effective play, each commander must perform competently and communicate clearly. Failures in coordination can quickly lead to disaster.

=== Playing Time

Playing the entire *Campaign for North Africa* requires at least 1,200 hours of
play time, likely more. Each Game-Turn takes approximately ten hours, although
less time may be required during turns with limited movement or combat. This is
a long game. Individual Game-Turns may occasionally be completed in two hours,
but such speed usually occurs only when both sides are logistically exhausted.
The length of play is deliberate: the level of involvement allows players to
make virtually all of the operational and strategic decisions that the original
commanders were required to make.

== Glossary and Unit Definitions

[#3_1]
=== Definitions of Terms

*Cohesion Level*::
A measure of how combat-effective a unit is at a given point in time. Cohesion is affected by acquiring Reorganization Points and by receiving Disorganization Points.

*Combat Air Patrol (CAP)*::
Offensive CAP involves searching for and intercepting enemy aircraft. Defensive CAP involves escorting friendly aircraft.

*Combat Unit*::
Any unit capable of engaging enemy units and/or aircraft in combat. Headquarters, Engineers, and Dummy Tank Formations are considered combat units in certain situations.

*Combined Arms Attack*::
A Close Assault in which tanks must be supported by at least an equal number of infantry units. If not, tank combat values are reduced.

*Desert Raider*::
A special company-sized unit operating in jeeps, capable of limited movement and combat and normally unobserved by the opposing player.

*Reaction*::
A unit's ability to evade combat. This is directly related to the degree of motorization or mechanization of the unit.

*Efficiency Level*::
A unit's ability to embark and disembark troops, equipment, and supplies, and to withstand damage.

*Engineering Capability*::
The ability of a Headquarters unit to construct or demolish game items. Includes Anti-Aircraft units, certain artillery types, and Anti-Tank units when assigned.

*Gun*::
An artillery or anti-tank weapon represented either independently or as part of a unit.

*Sequential Dice Roll*::
A dice roll using two dice read as a two-digit number from 11 through 66. The larger die provides the tens digit; the smaller die provides the ones digit.

*Headquarters (HQ)*::
A unit composed of independent subsidiary units (including trucks), represented either by a counter or by separate counters.

*Shell Unit*::
A combat unit possessing fewer than the minimum number of TOE Strength Points and/or subsidiary units.

*Barrage*::
An attack that negates the requirement for adjacent friendly units to conduct a Close Assault against the target enemy unit.

*Initiative*::
The side (Axis or Allied) that determines which player acts first in each Operations Stage of the Campaign Turn.

*Involuntary Movement*::
Movement forced upon a unit as a result of a Retreat outcome from Close Assault combat.

*Log Sheet*::
A paper record used to track specific information and status for a unit. One Log Sheet is required for each counter on the map.

*Maneuver Element*::
Those forces within a division or brigade normally responsible for offensive ground combat (primarily tank and infantry units).

*Morale*::
The ability and willingness of troops to fight. All combat units possess a Basic Morale Rating, which may be improved through successful combat.

*Motorized Unit*::
A unit whose movement is provided by wheeled or tracked vehicles. Some units are always motorized; others may alternate between motorized and foot movement.

*Organization Size*::
The scale of a unit, measured in Division-, Brigade-, Battalion-, or Company-Equivalents (Eq).

*Organization at Arrival Chart (OA Chart)*::
A chart listing the arrival date, original composition, and initial strength of each unit entering play.

*Parent Unit*::
A counter representing a larger unit that contains or controls smaller assigned or attached units.

*Pinned*::
A possible result of Air Bombardment or Barrage. A pinned unit may not voluntarily move or initiate combat for the remainder of the current sub-Phase and is placed in Reserve.

*Ready Aircraft*::
Aircraft that have been armed, fueled, and refitted and are prepared to fly and perform missions.

*Reinforcement*::
A unit that does not begin on the map but enters play at a specified later time.

*Replacement*::
Personnel and equipment used to rebuild destroyed units or increase the effectiveness of existing units.

*Squadron Ground Support Unit (SGSU)*::
The headquarters and support unit responsible for aircraft operations.

*Stacking Point*::
A measure of the space a unit occupies in a hex or along a road or track during movement.

*Supplies*::
Consumable resources: Ammunition, Fuel, Stores, and Water.

*TOE Strength Point*::
A measure of manpower and equipment. Roughly equivalent to 100 men, 5–8 armored vehicles, or 4–8 guns.

*Transport Unit*::
A counter capable of expending Capability Points to move supplies or other units.

*Upgrading*::
The process of increasing a combat unit's effectiveness.

*Zone of Control (ZOC)*::
The area of influence surrounding a combat unit. Enemy units must stop upon
entering a hex in an opposing ZOC. CNA uses a rigid, active ZOC system.

[#3_2]
=== Unit Differentiation

[#3_21]
*[3.21]* Units are differentiated into the following categories:

* Infantry-Type
* Tank-Type
* Reconnaissance-Type
* Anti-Tank-Type
* Anti-Aircraft-Type
* Artillery-Type
* Engineer-Type
* Aircraft-Type
* Ground Support Units
* Recovery Squadrons
* Dummy Tank Formations
* Trucks

The counters representing each type are listed in the Counter Manifest <<4_2>>,
except for Dummy Tank Formations, which have no counters.

[#3_22]
*[3.22]* For Barrage and aircraft attacks (Strafing and Bombardment), units are grouped into the following classes:

Infantry-class: All Infantry-Type, Engineers,
Headquarters possessing a defensive Close Assault
Rating but not possessing an Armor Protection
Rating, SGSU, and Recce-Type that do not
possess an Armor Protection Rating.

Armor-class: All Tank-Type, Dummy Tank Formations, Tank Recovery Squadrons, headquarters
possessing an Armor Protection Rating, RecceType possessing an Armor Protection Rating, and
those Artillery and Anti-tank-Type units possessing an Armor Protection Rating (SPA and Tank
Destroyers).

Gun-class: All Artillery-Type, Anti-aircraft-Type
and Anti-tank-Type units comprised of any TOE
Strength Points not possessing an Armor Protection Rating, includingHQs and infantry with Barrage capability.

Truck-class: All Trucks.

[note]
====
Any Artillery or Anti-tank unit that is comprised of weapons (TOE Strength Points) with an
Armor Protection Rating and of weapons without
one are considered ¢wo units for target purposes.
====

[#3_23]*[3.23]* Combat units consist of all Infantry-Type, Tank-Type Recce-Type,
Artillery-Type, Antitank-Type, and Anti-aircraft-Type units. For certain
determinations, such as Zone of Control, Reconnaissance, Barrage and
Bombardment, certain non-combat units may be considered combat units.

[#3_3]
=== HEADQUARTERS UNITS

HQ's serve two functions: They act as command coordination for the individual
units under them, and they also represent, when on the game-map, all of the
units attached to that HQ.

[#3_31]*[3.31]* HQ units represent all combat units, Trucks (and their
Supplies), etc. attached to that counter. If any combat units are attached, the
HQ counter itself is considered a combat unit, and fights with the combined
strengths of all units in it.

[#3_32]*[3.32]* An HQ (and for that matter, all Parent Units) have a CPA equal
to the CPA of the 'slowest' unit attached to the HQ.

[#3_33]*[3.33]* The Stacking Points printed on the HQ are those of a full
complement of units. Thus a divisional HQ representing an entire division
occupies 5 Stacking Points of space. The rules on unit Equivalents (see
<<9_2>>) discuss what happens if the division operates at less than full strength.
If an HQ has no combat units attached it occupies zero Stacking Points and may
use its parenthesized Ratings. It is no longer considered to be a combat unit
and may not voluntarily attack.

[#3_34]*[3.34]* Certain HQ units, mostly with the Italian Army, have artillery
assigned to regimental HQ's (guns directly under command of the HQ). These HQ's
may use their combat strengths, and losses for the guns are taken as regular
losses. However, when all gun TOE Strength Points are eliminated, the HQ is not
destroyed: it reverts to the status of a non-combat HQ.

[#3_35]*[3.35]* Armored Division and Armored Brigade HQ units usually have a
"platoon" of tanks assigned, as Players will note by the ratings of each such
HQ. These tanks may not be used in combat unless the HQ has no combat units
attached.  Tanks assigned to HQ's may not be transferred to combat units,
regardless of the situation. If such an HQ loses its tanks, they should be
replaced by the first available Tank Replacement Points. HQ's with tanks
attached are not subject to Breakdown.

[#3_36]*[3.36]* An HQ unit that has no combat values, either with or without
parentheses, is captured instantly if it is in a hex without any combat units
and an Enemy combat unit places the HQ in its Zone of Control. There is no
Capability Point expenditure required for such a capture, and the HQ is treated
as one Prisoner Point.

[#3_4]
=== COMBAT UNITS

CNA has a great variety of combat units — more than 25 different types, not
including aircraft.  Although the structure of the game is operational, there
has been an attempt to inject a "tactical" flavor into the game by
differentiating between the functions of the various units. However, players
should keep in mind that this is an operational game, and that many purely
tactical functions have been abstracted or ignored. Below is a brief resume of
the various types of units, noting any exceptions. Some of the completely
familiar units have been omitted.

_Motorized Infantry_: These are infantry units that are usually transported in
Trucks. (The British often called their units Lorried infantry.) Motorized
Infantry units must actually have Trucks in order to use their Motorized CPA
(i.e., that of the Truck). Otherwise they are regular "foot" Infantry. Units
that were usually motorized are so indicated on the units' Characteristics
Charts.

_Mechanized Infantry_: Primarily, these units were not only motorized but also
usually supplied with some Armored Cars, half-tracks, armored Personnel
carriers, etc. Unless there is a terrible and total emergency, Mechanized
Infantry should remain motorized at all times.

_Motorcycle Infantry/Reconnaissance_: These are mostly Italian Bersaglierei
mitraglieri (motorcycle) units (plus two German battalions of Kradschutzen). The
equipment is the popular two-man cycle, plus a few jeeps, Armored Cars, etc.
Weaponry was pretty good, with a high percentage of machineguns; thus their
relatively high firepower. Cycles may not enter hexes prohibited to Light
Trucks. Moreover, even though motorcycles are vehicles, they do not use Fuel nor
do they suffer Breakdown.

_Heavy Weapons Units_: There are several of these units, such as the German
Schwerste-Infanteriegeschutz units. Equipment varied, but often included
machineguns, mortars, some light artillery and anti-tank guns, perhaps a light
AA battery. It varies from unit to unit.

_Garrison Infantry_: These units are virtually the sole property of the Italians
— and they are usually welcome to them. Most Italian Garrison Infantry came from
the GaF Settore di Coperture Regiments, comprised of over-age Italians living in
Libya. Their training was minimal, their spirits low, their performance poor.
However, units labeled as garrison units (with a G on the counter — and this
includes all types of garrison units) stack free in the city or town which they
were originally assigned to garrison. E.g., the 30th GaF infantry units have
zero Stacking Poins when in Bardia. There is one Commonwealth unit which is
considered a Garrison: The Matruh Garrison. The OA Sheet gives specific
instructions on this unit.  unit.

_Airborne Infantry_: These are treated as normal infantry, unless they are
capable of being paradropped, which capability is listed on the Arrival Sheet
for that unit. See <<40_4,[40.4]>>.

_Armored Recce and Armored Car units_: Recce units usually comprise light
armored cars (Bren Carriers, Autoblindas, etc.), while the Armored Car units
have some tanks (Stuarts, PzII's, etc.) and heavier cars. The sole difference is
the fact that Armored Car units are virtually light Tank Battalions. (The
British considered Recce as infantry, but Armored Car as Armored units.) Recce
and AC units have remarkable mobility and are best used to probe and freeze
(Pin) small enemy formations.

_Artillery_: The Artillery units in the game comprise a wide variety of weapons,
from 65mm Infantry guns up to 21cm German howitzers and British 5.5" howitzers.
Some of the minor guns have been ignored or combined into one "piece" with
similar ratings. Italian mortar companies have been melded into the regimental
HQ's and ad hoc artillery units. Ratings for guns and howitzers were based on
Range and Penetration effect, as well as rate of fire and type of shell. Unless
stated otherwise on the Arrival Sheet, all Artillery has its own intrinsic
(built-in) transport, transport which may never be stripped (unless you wish to
abandon the guns).  Artillery units use Fuel (when moving) as well as Water.
However, they are not subject to Breakdown. Players will also note that certain
Artillery units have more than one type of gun (e.g., the 221st Artillery Regt.
of the German 90th Light Division). All guns belong to the same unit and they
are treated as one unit.

_Self-Propelled Artillery_: These are guns mounted on Tank or quasi-tank
chassis. They fire like guns and have Vulnerability Ratings, but they also may
be destroyed by Anti-Tank Fire. Their advantage is in increased mobility and
Assault value. SP Artillery consumes Fuel and Water and _ suffers Breakdown.

_Coastal Defense Guns_: These artillery units always have a CPA of 10 for combat
purposes only, unless they have printed CPAs of greater than ten. They may not
be moved unless Trucks are attached and assigned to that purpose. Guns with a
'0' (not '0+') CPA are emplaced and may never be moved. Emplaced Guns do not
possess a Vulnerability Rating and may be destroyed only by Barrage, Capture or
Air Bombardment. Cost Defense Artillery that is motorized is subject to
Breakdown.

_Anti-Tank Units_: These have "guns" with the ability to pierce armor, thus
destroying tanks and other armored units. There are certain TOE Strength Points,
not specifically anti-tank, that also have this ability: British 25-pdrs., the
famous German 88mm Flak units, Italian 75mm and 90mm AA/Flak units, etc. British
Heavy Antiaircraft units, with 3.7" guns, theoretically had the capability to
fire as anti-tank weapons. However, British doctrine was such that they were
never (well, hardly ever) used in this role. ("If they were meant to be used as
anti-tank guns they would have been called anti-tank guns." Apocryphal, but
true.) Unless self-propelled, anti-tank units are notarmored.

_Anti-Aircraft/Flak Units_: Of all the units in the game, AA/Flak unis suffered
the most liberties in terms of design. The myriad and voluminous AA/Flak
batteries spread over Africa were often combined into larger regiments and
battalions, making the historical battalions/regiments seem larger than they
perhaps were. AA/Flak units comprise a fairly wide section of weapons: British
40mm, as well as the ill-used 3.7"s, German 20 and 88mm's, plus Italian 20mm's,
75's and 90mm's.  Many of these guns had other tactical uses, apart from
shooting down planes. Thus AA/Flak units are given a variety of ratings, most of
them parenthesized. Some units, especially German 88's, can be used in many
roles. These decisions were not based on innate capabilities, but rather on
tactical doctrine and actual usage.

_Units with Parenthesized Strengths_: Certain combat units —and certain
non-combat units— have parenthesized Combat Ratings. These ratings may be used
only if such a unit is in a hex not occupied by Friendly combat units with
appropriate nonparenthesized ratings is attacked by Enemy units.

[#3_5]
=== UNIT CHARACTERISTICS

Each counter comprises a number of TOE Strength Points. The unit's abilities are
those of the TOE Strength Points comprising it (certain counters may exist if
there are no TOE Strength Points in them; these possess only a Capability Point
Allowance). The following is a brief ex- planation of the units'
characteristics:

_Capability Point Allowance (abbr. CPA)_: The unit's ability to execute movement
and combat, stated numerically,

_Barrage Rating_: A combat strength expressing the relative capability of that
unit to inflict damage when firing as an artillery piece (i.e., indirect fire).

_Vulnerability_: A numerical expression of a gun's susceptibility to being
destroyed or captured when in a Forward Position (see <<12_1>>). It is based
mostly on the gun's range and tactical usage doctrine.

_Anti-armor Strength_: A numerical expression of a unit's ability to destroy
armored vehicles.

_Armor Protection Rating_: The ability of an armored vehicle to withstand enemy anti-armor fire.
This is based on the vehicle's armor thickness and excellence of construction.

_Offensive Close Assault Rating_: The ability, stated numerically, of a unit to
engage enemy forces in "hand-to-hand" (i.e., Close Assault) combat.

_Defensive Assault Rating_: The ability, stated numerically, of a unit to defend
against a Close Assault.

_Anti-aircraft Rating_: A numerical expression of a unit's ability to shoot down
aircraft (this ability occurs, aside from anti-aircraft units, only ina few
headquarters, tanks, and other units).

_Maximum TOE Strength_: This is, all things con- sidered, the most important
number on the sheet (see <<4_46>>). It is the numerical expression of the
manpower (for infantry), tank platoons (for armored units), or batteries (for
guns) in that unit.  The infantry manpower figures are based roughly on anywhere
from 100 to 200 men, depending on the combat function of the individual and his
use within the unit. The tank platoons are calculated in groups of five to eight
vehicles. The gun bat- teries are calculated in groups of four guns.

_Basic Morale Rating_: A numerical (and somewhat subjective) expression of a
unit's training, combat experience, and esprit d'corps, on a scale of +3
(excellent) to ""3 (armed rabble with minimal in- terest in anything harmful).
Certain Com- monwealth units must be Trained in order to reach their listed
Basic Morale.

_Fuel Rate_: A simplified reduction of the vehicle's miles per gallon
efficiency.

_Breakdown Adjustment Rating_: An expression, stated numerically, of the general
construction and ease of maintenance of a vehicle coupled with the level of
mechanical competence of the unit per- forming the maintenance.

== GAME EQUIPMENT

[#4_1]
=== THE GAME-MAPS

The game-map takes up a great deal of space (it is almost ten feet in length),
and it is virtually impossible to play any scenario without all the maps.
This is because of the logistical nature of the game and the emphasis on supply
lines and transport.  Players will also find that they will be using areas of
the game-map for dropping counters, piling markers, etc. True, there are areas
of the maps that will remain virtually untouched by combat units. Simply
remember what's in play, and what is just being used. Playtesting of CNA, which
usually took anywhere from six to 12 Players at any given time, revealed, among
other things, that most action took place in one section of the game- maps. It
can get pretty crowded in that area at times, so try to keep your displays and
other information out of harm's way.

For those Players experiencing difficulties, the five Map Sections are labeled A
through E and are laid long side by long side from west to east respectively
(see diagram). The Map Sections should be laid so that the Oixx hexrow of a Map
Section overlays the 39xx hexrow of the Map Section whose letter immediately
preceeds it in the alphabet (that is, Map Section E partially overlays Map
Section D which partially overlays Map Section C, etc.).

[#4_2]
=== THE COUNTERS

There are actually few counters in play at any one given time. However, each
division on the game- map is comprised of a large number of lesser-sized units.
These battalions and brigades might be brought into use at any given time, so
the players should sort their counters into divisions, and organize their
divisions so that they know where the individual units of that division are. It
may even be wise to have a separate table for placement of such units.

[#4_25]*[4.25]* *Counter Deployment*

A unit attached to another unit is not represented by a counter on the game
map.

For example: The First Greek Infantry Brigade Group is comprised of the Ist
Greek Brigade HQ counter, the Ist Greek Field Artillery Regiment counter and the
Ist Greek Infantry, 2nd Greek Infantry and 3rd Greek Infantry Battalions
counters. If the three infantry battalions and the artillery regiment were
attached to the headquarters unit, the entire brigade would be represented on
the game map by the headquarters counter. Unless specifically stated, all
assigned units beginning a scenario in the same hex as their parent unit are
attached to that parent unit. The counters representing said units are therefore
not deployed on the game-map.

[#4_26]*[4.26] Holding Boxes*

Certain hexes on the game-map "attract" a large number of counters. These hexes
are represented by Holding Boxes which are nothing more than large spaces for
deploying all of the counters which are actually located in the hex the Holding
Box is representing.

[#4_3]
=== CHARTS AND TABLES

There are an inordinate number of Charts and Tables in CNA. Most of them can be
found in the Charts and Tables Booklet. However, some are located on separate
loose sheets of paper or printed on the game-map or in the Rules booklets.

[#4_4]
=== ORGANIZATION AND ARRIVAL SYSTEM

In any given scenario, the Players receive units via the Initial Deployment
(given in each scenario) and via the Reinforcement Schedules. In addition to
these, Players may plan for Replacement Points to augment depleted units; the
discussion of these can be found in <<20_2>>. The Cases below give the Players
a base for using and understanding the terminology and location of the terms
and tables for acquiring and using units.

[#4_41]*[4.41]* There are three types of charts which the Player will refer to
in order to gain information on his units. These are the Characteristics Charts,
which show what capabilities and characteristics each unit or unit-type has (in
terms of. ratings and numbers), the "OA" Sheets, which list the organization of
units and arrival dates for each parent unit (usually division), and the
Reinforce- ment Schedules, which list the names and dates of all newly arriving
land units. Air units have separate reinforcement charts and tables which
determine their arrival.

[#4_42]*[4.42]* The following procedure is used to deter- mine which units
arrive during a Game-Turn and the abilities of those arriving units. The Player
consults the appropriate Reinforcement Schedule and determines the current
Operations Stage of the Game-Turn in progress; noting the units arriving, he
finds the OA (Organization at Arrival) Chart for each of those units. Parent
Formations are easy to find (e.g., divisions and brigades); smaller detachments
arriving piecemeal are usually given their parent formation for easy reference
to the correct OA Sheet. Having located the correct OA Sheet for each unit, the
Player notes the Characteristics Code for each individual unit (that has
arrived) in that Parent, and refers to the Characteristics Charts to determine
the capabilities of those units. Each Parent unit arrives with all lesser
units listed on the OA Chart, unless the unit has a later arrival date and/or is
listed as excluded on the Reinforcement Track.  Players should then draw up a
TOE Sheet for each such Parent Formation (and its lesser units). To more clearly
understand the above procedure, Players should at this time run through a sample
turn of Reinforcements, using any turn on the Track. Such a brief examination
will quickly show how this process operates.

[note]
====
The Player is provided with an inter-locking series of charts and tables,
each dependent on the other for information. Although there are a lot of tables
and the profusion may seem confusing, just a brief scanning of these tables and
tracks will be enough to show how they work. Remember, each different table or
track provides a piece of information, and the tables and tracks often contain
information found on the other such tracks or tables for purposes of
cross-checking. Example: The Reinforcement Schedule shows the arrival of the
18th Australian Brigade. The Commonwealth Player, noting that, looks forthe OA
Sheet for the 18th Australian Brigade. The OA Sheet also gives the Arrival Date,
which is a cross-check with the Reinforcement Schedule. The Player now notes the
units within the brigade, their Characteristic Code Letters, and consults the
Unit Characteristics Charts for those units to determine what their capabilities
are. This information is then placed on the TOE Sheet for the 18th Brigade,
along with any other information needed or desired.
====

[#4_43]*[4.43] Reinforcement Schedules*
(see Charts and Tables)

[#4_44]*[4.44] Aircraft Characteristics Charts*

There are two identically organized Aircraft Characteristics Charts one for each
Player. Within each nationality the planes are grouped into those needing
pilots and those not requiring pilots. Each plane is listed individually.
Certain bear two or more rows of information. With these planes the owning
Player may freely choose which line of characteristics and capabilities he will
assign that plane every time he readies it. The explanation of the various
ratings is discussed in <<34_1>> of the Air Game.

[#4_45]*[4.45] Organization At Arrival Charts (OA)*

A great deal of time (perhaps too much time) was spent in arriving at the most
accurate Order of Battle possible. As with any major campaign, sources differed,
and the designers were forced, for a variety of reasons, to make several
decisions which abstracted some units (especially anti-aircraft units). We feel
that CNA has, by far, the most accurate Order of Battle ever done for the
Campaign for North Africa. However, if you have information to the contrary
about a specific unit, feel free to adjust the game to fit that information. If
you feel like it, we would also like to hear about that information.

There are three identically organized OA Charts, one for Allied units, one for
German units, and one for Italian units. Each chart is subdivided into sections
hereafter termed sheets. Each sheet contains game and historical information
on a major unit or grouping of units (e.g., all unassigned artillery units;
50th Infantry Division) of that Player's forces. The sheet is laid out as
follows: the name of the major unit or regrouping is at the top.  Below that is
the Basic Morale Rating for all of the counters comprising that unit (untrained
Commonwealth unit's morale at instant of arrival is indicated in parentheses
where needed). This is followed by a list of the counters comprising the unit
and any notes at the bottom of the sheet. The counters comprising the unit are
arranged with the headquarters unit (if any) for that group at the top. Any
units assigned directly to that HQ are indented, and any unit assigned to a
subsidiary unit is further indented and listed in the rows directly below their
brigade level parent unit. The explanation of the information contained under
the column headings is as follows:

_Unit Name_: The historical name of that unit. Certain abbreviations have been
made for each nationality and they are listed at the end of the Chart.

_Counter Abbreviation_: The type as it appears on the counter.

_ID Code_: One, two, or three letters which summarize the unit's
 characteristics. The unit's ratings for a particular ID Code
are listed on the Unit Characteristics Chart for that nationality.

_TOE and Weapons Systems_: A unit comprised of a
single type of weapons system (i.e., TOE Strength Points with identical
cHaracteristics) bears an N(ormal), U(nderstrength), or. O(verstrength)
indicator. If the unit is normal, it arrives (or begins deployed) at its maximum
possible TOE Strength.  If the unit arrives understrength or overstrength its
TOE Strength at arrival will follow the U or O. If, on arrival, a unit comprises
tank, artillery, or antitank TOE Strength Points, the number and then the type
of the different TOE Strength Points will be listed.'

_Arrives_: The Operation Stage/Game-Turn on which the unit arrives. If the unit
beings the first scenario already deployed on the map, it is noted as a D. This
column is a check on the Reinforcement Schedule.

The OA Sheets are needed for a purpose other than pure numerical information.
The OA Sheets list the units originally assigned to a Parent unit.  This is
important, as units assigned to a Parent unit may stack and unstack, attach and
detach themselves quite freely compared to other units being attached to that
same Parent unit. The OA Sheets also, on occasion, list units that were
historically attached to a Parent Formation at certain times during the
Campaign.

There are numerous units that are not assigned to a division. These may be
brigades (the Commonwealth Player has many of these) or simply solitary
battalions, artillery regiments, etc. These units are grouped on OA Sheets
according to their most important assignment characteristics (i.e., all of the
British unassigned anti-air units are on a single OA Sheet).

The designers of CNA have chosen the division/brigade/battalion terminology
system because it was (1) the basic system of a majority of the units in the
campaign, and (2) the system with which they were most familiar. In many places
it does not reflect the actual organizational levels of a unit. This is further
exacerbated by the maddening British desire to call everything a regiment or a
brigade when, in fact, it is a battalion. Thus, the 7th Rifle Brigade is, in
game terms, a battalion (actually the 7th Battalion, the Rifle Brigade) and most
of the "Tank Regiments" are battalion-size units. Most Players familiar with the
campaign should have little trouble with items such as these (few people will
think that the 1st King's Royal Rifle Corps is, in fact, an actual Corps).

[#4_46]*[4.46] Unit Characteristics Charts*

There are three identically organized Unit Characteristics charts, one for
Allied units, one for German units and one for Italian units. The Unit
Characteristics Chart lists each ID Code's maximum TOE Strength Points and its
values for the various Ratings. Unless otherwise indicated on the chart, all
tank, artillery, anti-tank, and certain HQ units may comprise any combination of
the variety of the weapons systems listed. These units take on the
characteristics of the assigned TOE Strength Points (weapons systems). A unit
comprising multiple weapons systems is a single unit for all purposes.
However, all actions are undertaken using the ratings of the individual TOE
Strength Points (e.g., an artillery unit comprising two TOE Strength Points of
eighteen pounder guns and four TOE Strength Points of twenty-five pounder guns
engaging in Barrage will fire at two times the eighteen pounder gun Barrage
Rating plus four times the twenty-five pounder gun Barrage Rating). Note that a
unit comprising different TOE Strength Points normally possess a CPA of that of
the slowest TOE Strength Point. The characteristics of the individiual weapons
systems are listed on the appropriate nationality's Tank and Gun
Characteristics' Chart. Certain unit posses parenthesized combat ratings. These
units are discussed in <<3_3>>. Certain headquarters units' maximum limit in
assigned TOE Strength Points are enclosed in parentheses. Any weapons system TOE
Strength Points assigned to such a unit operate with parenthesized combat
values.  Players should note that the maximum number of assigned TOE Strength
Points for British Tank Regiments (battalion-equivalents) changes slightly in
early 1942, with the influx of the first American tanks. Tank regiments with
only American tanks (Grants and/or Shermans and/or Stuarts) now have a maximum
of 9 TOE Strength Points, not ten. The reason for this decision is not clear;
the allotment of tanks to a regiment, however, was dropped from 52 to 44 when
the tanks were American. This was readjusted later on.


[#4_47]*[4.47] Commonwealth Tank and Gun Characteristics Chart*
(see charts and tables)

This chart lists the values for TOE Strength Points
of a specific type of tank or gun. The definitions of
these characteristics are listed in <<3_3>>.

=== LOG SHEETS

Because of the enormous amount of information provided with CNA, and because of
the game system devised for its use, there are a great number of Play-aids, in
the form of Informational Sheets.  The playing counters themselves have little
combat information other than the unit designations and Stacking Points, and
there are few "tracks" by which the Players can keep visual record of various
supply levels. The reasons for this are many: the desire of the designer to
include as much information as possible; the problem of keeping vital
information secret from other Players; the fact that the game-map itself is so
large that having a plethora of charts and tracks would make it necessary to
rent The Hearst Estate at San Simeon to play it, etc. Therefore, players will
keep track of virtually all the information they need which is quite extensive
on the various sheets. The following sections describe these sheets,
although we hope that they have been so designed that their utilization becomes
self-evident. Players should feel free to devise any other sheets or methods
they feel necessary to ease the flow of the game; most of the sheets in CNA were
"designed" by the playtesters.

One copy of each type of Log Sheet is provided with CNA. Players should
therefore produce as many copies of each form as they need, The designers
suggest you use pencils and write lightly to make complete erasures easy.

[#4_51]*[4.51]* The Log Sheets have been divided into four groups on the basis
of their "owning" Player's usage. This is simply a presentation decision and
has no effect on who actually uses what in a game.

[#4_52]*[4.52] Field Commander's Group*

These forms are used by the Players in charge of frontline fighting combat
units.

_Field Commander Control Sheet_: This is designed to help the Field Commander
coordinate his forces. Each row on the sheet is meant for each counter on the
game-map under the Player's control. These counters will normally be
Division-Eq, and a few Brigade-Eq's. Space is provided for keeping track of the
unit's Capability Point expenditure(s) in that Operations Stage, its Capability
Point Allowance (CPA), current Cohesion Level, Actual Points the unit could
contribute to a Barrage and Offensive and Defensive Close Assault, and its
reserves of Ammo and Fuel. There is space for your "weekly" Stores requirements
for the units as a whole (Players rarely transport Stores on Attached Trucks,
because the Stores are required only once per game-week). The bottom section of
the sheet is for notes, normally detailing peculiarities of certain of the units
attached to the counters listed above them on the sheet.

_TOE Log Sheets_: There are three of these in order to ease handling five basic
division formation and organization structures and counters representing
Brigade-Eq and smaller units. The TOE Log Sheets are the equivalent, for play
purposes, of a giant combat unit counter. Each Parent Unit possesses its own TOE
Log Sheet, and on it the Players keep track of the various strengths and ratings
of the units within that formation, the changes to them and the supplies and
trucks carried by and attached to that unit. The sheets can all be divided into
the following sections or information areas:

_A: Counter Identity_: This is the area on the top of the sheet. The counter's
historical name, its Basic Morale, its Current Morale (if Commonwealth), and
any other useful information (such as its assigned Parent Unit, if any, Garrison
location, engineering capability, etc.) should be written in this section.

_E: Logistics_: This is the area marked "1st Line Transport." The area is
subdivided into Trucks Available and Supplies. The first grouping consists of
two paired rows of three boxes. They are for indicating the total attached
Trucks and of those trucks, which are currently transporting nothing, by
division into Heavy, Medium and Light trucks. The second grouping is for
supplies and troops and/or guns being motorized by the attached trucks by the
amount and the number of trucks and the type that are carrying them.

_F: Combat Information_: Boxes for recording (usually the maximum) number of
actual Points that the unit is capable of in each of the categories.

_D: Augmentation_: This is for recording the attachment of units over that
formation's organization structure. (See Section on <<19_0,Unit Organization>>). The method of
filling out the boxes in this section is identical to that of Maneuver and
Division Assets below. Any unit going i this section is attached to the counter
the Log Sheet represents, although it may be assigned to some other unit.

_G. Notes_: Anything appropriate, ranging from which units are out of ammo or
supplies to the amount of Water required by the elements comprising the counter
every Operations Stage.

_C Divisional Assets/Support Units_: Applies to those units attached directly to
the division and not under a Brigade-Eq HQ (unless ina Common wealth Armored
Division). The boxes are filled in the same manner as Maneuver section.

_B. Maneuver Elements_: These boxes are the heart of the Log Sheet. They are
where the information for the main combat forces comprising the counter is
recorded. Basically, each box is used to record a single counter (i.e.,
attached unit). The information to be recorded consists of the unit's type,
CPA, Fuel and Breakdown Rates (if any), current TOE Strength, name, and its
ratings for barrage, anti-armor, vulnerability, armorprotection, offensive
close assault, defensive close assault and anti-aircraft. Information
concerning whether the unit is simply attached to the unit without being
assigned, and/or is assigned to another parent unit or is a garrison unit,
etc., is best recorded in the notes section. A tank or gun unit that is
comprised of more than one weapons system (i.e., type of TOE Strength Point)
will require more than one box to represent the unit (as many boxes as there
are weapons systems). A unit assigned but not at present attached to the unit
whose Log Sheet you are handling still occupies space within the formation's
organization. This space may not be filled by attaching other units in its
place. For ease of play, fill in "detached" in the box of sucha unit.

The recorded information may be written in or adjacent to the unit's box in any
manner the Player desires as long as he and the other Player's have no problems
in reading it.

_Brigade TOE Log Sheet_: This is used for counters representing Brigade-Eq and
smaller units. The formation's organization limits can be found by using the
Formation Organization Chart and the Formation Attachment Chart. It is useful
to put these limits in the Notes Section. As this is a multipurpose form, the
boxes in the Maneuver Elements and Augmentation sections are unadorned and can
be divided in any manner necessary.

_Infantry Division TOE Log Sheet_: The boxes in the Maneuver Elements section are
organized in a very restricted fashion. Some of the boxes in the Divisional
Assets and all of the boxes in the Augmentation sections are unadorned to
permit recording of multiple weapons systems occurring in the same unit. The
division's organization and augmentation limits can be determined from the
charts indicated above.

Allied and Italian Armored and German Division TOE Log Sheets This is free form
with the boxes unstructured so as to permit the expected variations in both
multiple weapons systems in a single unit and variations in division
organization.

[#4_53]*[4.53] Rear Area Commander's Group*

This group belongs to the Player in charge of construction, demolition, mopping
up operations, and other rear area jobs having nothing to do with supplies.
(The Player will usually have a Trucks and Major End Items Control Sheet as he
will normally be assigned some trucks in order to handle routine operations
without bothering the Logistics Commander).

_Vehicle Repair Control Sheet_: Permits the Player to handle all broken down
vehicle, destroyed tanks and abandoned vehicle counters.

_Naval Convoy Log Sheet_: While designed primarily for Axis strategic Naval
convoys it is also used for either Player's tactical shipping. The sheet permits keeping track of naval transport, its location, destination, transit, what is being transported, etc.

_POW Control Sheet_: Designed to handle all POW's, their Capability Points
expended, location and inhabitation of the POW Camps, and the TOE Strength and
infantry-type of their Guards.

[#4_54]*[4.54] Air Marshal's Group*

The Player in charge of all the airplanes uses the following two forms and
usually the Supply Dump Control Sheet to simplify required aircraft supply
expenditures the aircraft require.

_Squadron Ground Support Unit Sheet_: The sheet contains space for controlling
six squadrons of planes, the maximum number that can be berthed at an airfield.
Each squadron section permits counter location, basic composition, aircraft
characteristics recording, and the state and Mission of each plane in the
squadron.

_Air Mission Log Sheet_: Permits the Player to coordinate all air missions
assigned in that Operations Stage/Game-Turn, by hex and by squadron supplying
the planes.

[#4_55]*[4.55] Logistics Commander's Group*

The Player in overall charge of supplies.

_Trucks and Major End Items Control Sheet_: Used for the Player's Truck Convoys.
Organized to identify, within each counter, the number of each type of truck in
the convoy, what supplies are being transported and by what trucks; which
trucks are ‘empty', any replacement points, repaired vehicles, returning
Guards, etc., being returned or exchanged between units.

_Supply Dumps Control Sheet_: Enables the Player to keep track of the supplies
and location of each of his supply dumps. It is strongly suggested that the
Logistics Commander determine which of his dumps will be actively or constantly
used and those which are not and separate them into different sheets, as the
actual supply dump counter ID number has no effect.

_General Supply Net Sheet_: The .Logistics Commander's chief headaches are how
much supply does he have, how much is coming in, and how much of that supply is
likely to be used in the near future. This sheet is set up to help prevent him
from running out of a supply by accident, as it were, either locally or
strategically.

_Supply Requisition Form_: The Logistics Commander is in charge of disbursing
these to the various Field Commanders and Air Marshals. This may seem humorous
at this point, but the form proved quite helpful in maintaining good supply
organization, and it sure beats yelling at the top of your voice for 100
gallons of fuel.

[note]
====
The process used to manufacture
counters sometimes results in images being slightly off-center or in colors
spilling along the edges of differently colored counters. Counters displaying
such minor imperfections cannot be replaced by SPI. Only in cases where the
counters are not legible can SPI supply replacement parts.
====

In the Land Game, the Players deal with the fine distinctions of terrain and
local and variable weather encountered by the actual combatants. The
interlocking and detailed movement and combat systems permit the Players to
recreate real time and space "continuous" movement and combat. The
organization and equipment rules create voluminous options, allowing the
Players to deploy and maneuver company level and larger forces with equal ease
while at the same time differentiating between raw, poorly motivated, or badly
armed units and veteran, well motivated, well equipped forces as well as
changes in the same unit from one state to the other.

[#5_0]
== THE SEQUENCE OF PLAY (Land Game)

[#5_1]
=== THE GAME-TURN

In CNA each Game-Turn covers a period of approximately one week. However, to
better handle combat operations, each Game-Turn is divided into three
Operations Stages. Each Operation Stage is the equivalent of 2-3 days of
activities and, within each such Stage, each Player performs a sequence of
events covering all aspects of the game. Thus the Players complete their
operations within one Operations Stage, proceed to the second, and then the
third, thus finishing one full Game-Turn. Certain operations are performed only
at the beginning of the actual Game-Turn. Most of the game operations —
movement and land combat — are performed within the Operations Stage. The basic
unit of time within the game is thus the Operations Stage.

[#5_2]
=== LAND GAME GAME-TURN SEQUENCE OUTLINE

This Sequence of Play applies when playing the Land Game without the Air and
Logistics Games.

[upperroman]
==== I. INITIATIVE DETERMINATION STAGE

The Players determine who will have the Initiative for the coming Game-Turn
(Section 7.0). The Player going first within an Operations Stage (below) is
known as Player "A"; the other as Player "B.”'

[upperroman]
==== II. NAVAL CONVOY STAGE 

[upperletter]
===== A. Naval Convoy Schedule Phase

The Axis Player plans what specific cargoes the ships will carry and their
routes. See <<32_0>> or Section <<56_0>>. The Axis Player plans for the arrival
of future Replacements from the Axis Replacement Points Pool. Likewise, the
Commonwealth Player consults the Commonwealth Production Table and determines
how many Replacement Points he will receive two turns henc and plans for their
arrival. .

===== B. Tactical Shipping Phase

Both Players plan the transport of cargo between African ports. Note: The Axis
Coastal Ships are represented in the game by counters. Allied coastal shipping
is not represented by counters and is limited only by the port capacities.

==== III. FIRST OPERATIONS STAGE 

===== A. Initiative Declaration Phase

The Player who gained the Initiative in Stage I now states whether he will be
Player "A" or Player "B" for this particular Operations Stage.

===== B. Weather Determination Phase 
The Player with Initiative rolls for Weather (<<29_0>>). 

===== C. Organization Phase

The following segments are undertaken in any order desired.

. _Reorganization Segment_: Attachment and/or assignment of Reinforcements, Replacements or any other non-assigned units including Trucks may be undertaken. Detachment of units may also be accomplished.

. _Construction Segment_: 
.. Construction Completion Step: Any work scheduled
for completion is finished, removing and adding any markers necessary. Units
that have finished construction are free to move. 

.. Construction Initiation/Continuation Step: any units beginning or continuing work on
projects are noted. They may not voluntarily move in the remainder of the
Operations Stage (Exception: Reaction).

. _Training Segment_: 

.. Training Completion Step: Units and Replacement Points
completing a level of Training are noted and the effects in Morale applied. 
.. Any units beginning or continuing Training are noted. They may not move
voluntarily in the remainder of the Operations Stage (Exception: Reaction). .

===== D. Naval Convoy Arrival Phase

All Reinforcements, Replacement Points and Ammo Points scheduled for Arrival
(and actually arriving) appear in their designated Ports of Arrival or Entrance
hexes.

===== E. Commonwealth Fleet Phase

. Fleet Assignment Segment: The Commonwealth Player assigns his ships to any
sea or coastal hexes.

. Fleet Repair Segment: Any Repair work on ships is undertaken at this time.

===== F. Reserve Designation Phase

Player "A" designates which of his units he is placing in Reserve Status,
indicating such with a Reserve I marker (see <<18_0>>).

===== G. The Movement and Combat Phase

The following four Segments comprise the Movement and Combat Phase. Player "A"
may if he so wishes, repeat Segments 1 through 4 as many times as he desires
within the restrictions of the Continual Movement Rules (<<8_2>>). Each repetition
must include all four segments. 

1. _Movement Segment_: All units, except
unattached Trucks and Tank Recovery Squadrons, not in Reserve and capable of
being moved may be moved. Non-Phasing (Player "B") units may React if
permitted and Player "B" wishes to do so. 

2. _Breakdown Determination Segment_:
All vehicles and motorized units of both sides check for Breakdown (<<2_10>>).
Broken down vehicles are indicated by a marker. 

3. Combat Segment: (Combat isresolved as follows see <<11_0>> through <<15_0>>).

.. Position Determination Step: Both Players determine the "position" of all Gun-and Armor-class units.

.. Barrage Step: Both Players secretly plot and then execute any Barrages. 

.. Retreat Before Assault Step: Player "B”' may Retreat Before Assault any of his
units permitted to doso. 

.. Force Assignment Step: Both Players secretly
assign TOE Strength Points to Anti-Armor or Close Assault. Player "A"
determines which Assaults will be Probes (although he need not reveal this
decision) and which TOE Strength Points will be withheld from Assault. 

.. Anti-Armor Step: Both Players simultaneously resolve any Anti-Armor Fire,
removing all casualties. Placement of Destroyed Tanks markers are made if
necessary. 

.. Close Assault Step: Close Assaults are resolved in any order that
Player "A" desires. He announces which Assaults are actually Probes after each
is resolved.

4. Reserve Release Segment: Player "A" may release any of his Reserves that he wishes.

===== H. Truck Convoy Movement Phase

Player "A" may move his Second and Third Line Trucks (unattached) and any
POW's and Guards.

===== J. Commonwealth Rail Movement Phase

If Player "A" is the Commonwealth Player he may utilize Rail Movement (<<8_7>>) for units and/or Supplies.

===== K. Repair Phase

1. _Towing Segment_: Player "A”' may tow Broken down and Recovered vehicles.

2. _Maintenance Segment_: Player "A" may attempt to Repair Broken down or
destroyed vehicles which were not towed in this Phase.

===== L. Patrol Phase

If the Phasing Player has not engaged in Assault, he may use Patrols for
reconnaissance purposes.

*At this point Player "B" undertakes Phases F through L, replacing any
references to "A” with “B" and "B" with "A"*

==== IV. SECOND OPERATIONS STAGE

Both Players repeat all facets of the First Operations Stage.

==== V. THIRD OPERATIONS STAGE

Both Players repeat ail facets of the First Operations Stage.

==== VI. END OF GAME-TURN

You have now completed one Game-Turn, a full week of the real campaign. Take a
breather, havea beer and a sandwich, contact your loved ones to let them know
you're still alive, and return for another Game-Turn.

[#6_0]
== THE CAPABILITY POINT SYSTEM

GENERAL RULE:

CNA uses a Capability Point system to control all aspects of a given land
unit's abilities. A unit's Capability Point Allowance (CPA) is a numerical
representation of a unit's ability to undertake any and all functions: movement
(including retreats and advances), combat, loading, transporting, construction,
etc. There is not a function in the game that will not cost a unit some of its
CPA (with some minor exceptions). CPA thus regulates each and every aspect of
play. Under certain circumstances units may exceed their CPA. To do so will
affect a unit's Cohesion, earning it Disorganization Points (which may affect
Morale). Yet, the ability to exceed its CPA allows a unit to stretch itself to
the limit, to perform feats it might not ordinarily perform — at a price. Players should thus keep close track of each unit's CP's expended and its Cohesion Level on the Sheets provided.

[#6_1] 
=== HOW THE CPA SYSTEM WORKS

[#6_11]*[6.11]* Each unit has a Capability Point Allowance (CPA). The CPA for
each unit is given on the OA Sheets. Certain Gun units have a CPA of "0” these
units are considered to have a CPA of 10 for all purposes other than movement.

[#6_12]*[6.12]* Every function that a unit would need to perform costs that
unit some portion of its CPA. The costs of each such function are listed on the
Capability Point Cost Table, Section <<6_3>>. Except where noted, everything a unit
does costs CP's.

[#6_13]*[6.13]* The CPA for a given unit refers to the number of Capability
Poins that unit may use in a given Operations Stage without earning
Disorganization Points (See <<6_2>>). Thus, a Tank Battalion with a CPA of '25'
could use 25 CP's in an Operations Stage without garnering any Disorganization
Points.

[#6_14]*[6.14]* The allotment of CP's for an Operations Stage refers to both
Players' portions of that Operations Stage. Thus, if the Axis Player goes
"last" in a given Operations Stage any CP's used by his units in Retreating,
Reacting, etc., during the Commonwealth portion of that Operations Stage are
counted against those units' CPA's for that Operations Stage. As the Operations
Stage progresses, Players should keep track of CP's expended by units on either
the TOE Sheet for that unit or on the Field Commander Control Sheet. 

*Example*: At the beginning of the first Operations Stage of the September III, 1940
Game-Turn (Game-Turn 1), the First Royal Northumberland Fusiliers (a
non-motorized, Machinegun battalion at this point) has a CPA of _eight_. To start
the game, the Italians move and attack the 1st RNF. They have no artillery and
do not barrage. The Allied Player decides to Retreat Before Assault three hexes
at a cost of six CP's. The 1st RNF did not use any CP's to defend, and the
Italians did not expend any CP's to Close Assault, as the Allied unit retreated
before any could be expended. Thus when the Commonwealth Player begins his
portion of that Operations Stage the Ist RNF battalion will have only two CP's
remaining before it exceeds its CPA and earns Disorganization Points.

[#6_15]*[6.15]* The CPA of a "Parent Formation”' (e.g., division, brigade,
etc.) is that of the /owest CPA of the units comprising that parent formation,
regardless of the CPA of any higher-CPA units. If the British 7th Armored
Division was to move as an entity (consult the OA Sheet for the 7th Arm. Div)
it would move with a CPA of ‘10', or that of its lowest-CPA unit — the Ist KRRC
(without trucks).

[#6_16]*[6.16]* A unit does not have to use all of its CP's in a single
Operations Stage. However, CP's not used in one Operations Stage do not carry
over into the next Operations Stage (unlike Cohesion Levels, which do). They
are not transferrable from one unit to another (although an infantry unit may
assume the CPA ofa truck if it is motorized; see 6.17).

[#6_17]*[6.17]* Certain units may become "motorized" during the game: i.e.,
Infantry units (those units witha basic CPA of 10 or less) may use Truck units
to transport them. Infantry units being thus transported by Truck units assume
the CPA of the Truck unit carrying them. Thus, if the Ist RNF were to be
motorized by Medium Trucks it would now have a CPA of ‘20', instead of ‘8'.
(See also Section <<8_9>>). Anti-air units with listed CPAs of 0+ may be motorized by assigning one Medium or one Heavy Truck Point per TOE
Strength Point of Artillery.

[#6_2] 
=== COHESION

Cohesion represents a unit's state of exhaustion and disintegration
(Disorganization) or elation (Reorganization). A unit with a Cohesion Level of
'0' is its normal self. A unit in Disorganization, with a minus Cohesion
Level, has probably been exerting itself beyond the normal call of duty, while
a unit with a plus Cohesion Level (Reorganization) has been winning battles.
The Cohesion Level of a unit affects its Morale Level at the instant of combat,
which in turn will affect its performance in that battle. (See Section <<17_0>>).

[#6_21]*[6.21]* Whenever a unit exceeds its CPA within a given Operations Stage
it earns Disorganization Points (DP's). For each Capability Point that a unit
uses over its CPA it earns one Disorganization Point. Thus, a unit witha CPA of
‘15° that uses 18 CP's in an Operations Stage earns three DP's. [A unit may
also earn DP's as a result of combat.] If a unit (Parent Formation as well as
all units in that formation) suffers losses of 30% or greater in any one Close
Assault it earns three DP's. (See also <<15_29b>>).

[#6_22]*[6.22]* DP's are used to decrease the Cohesion Level of a unit. Thus a
unit with a Cohesion Level of -1 that earns three DP's now has a Cohesion Level
of -4. DP's accumulate from Segment to Segment; they may be negated only by
certain actions on the part of the unit (See <<6_23>>). Furthermore, DP's are
credited immediately — not at the end of an Operations Stage. 

*Example*: the Ist
RNF, with a CPA of ‘8' and a Cohesion Level of -2 has expended five CP's in a
Movement Segment. It then assaults an Italian unit, expending the five CP's
necessary to do so. The Ist RNF has thus exceeded its CPA by two, earning 2
DP's and reducing its Cohesion Level by that two to -4. The decrease in the
Cohesion Level takes place before the Close Assault is resolved and the 1st RNF
uses its new Cohesion Level of -4 in computing any changes to Morale.

[#6_23]*[6.23]* A unit's Cohesion Level may be increased by earning
Reorganization Points (RP's). Under no circumstances, however, may a units
Cohesion Level ever go higher than plus ten (+10). RP's earned are added to a
unit's Cohesion Level in such a way as to make it "better". Thus a unit with a
Cohesion Level of -3 that earns five RP's has a new Cohesion Level of +2.
RP's, like DP's, are applied immediately.

[#6_24]*[6.24]* RP's are earned under the following circumstances:

1. For each Operations Stage in which a unit uses absolutely no CP's (except
for a unit undergoing Training or conducting Training; see <<18_3>>) that unit
earns five RP's. However, no unit may ever increase his Cohesion Level above
‘0' by this method. Thus, a unit with a Cohesion Level of -1 that uses no CP's
for an entire Stage would have a Cohesion Level of ‘0' at the end of that Stage
(not +4).

2. For each Close Assault in which a unit participates where the defending upit
vacates its hex completely as a direct result of that Close Assault (not
Reaction or Retreat Before Assault) that unit (victorious) earns fhree RP's.

[#6_25]*[6.25]* A unit with a positive Cohesion Level (e.g., +3) may have its
Basic Morale increased in a given Close Assault, while a unit with a negative
Cohesion Level (e.g., -12) may have its Morale lowered for a given combat (see
<<17_2>>).

[#6_26]*[6.26]* A unit with a Cohesion Level of -26 (or worse) may not move,
attack, or defend. If an enemy combat unit moves adjacent to it it Sur renders,
regardless of the size of the enemy unit. Such "disorganized" units may,
however, refuel, and they do consume Stores and Water. (Note, that a unit may
get a level of worse than -26 if it performs a sing/e action, such as an
attack that would jump it past the -26 level.)

[#6_27]*[6.27]* If a Player has more than one unit (or individual combat
counter) in a given Close Assault, and those individual units have different
Cohesion Levels, then the Cohesion Level of the largest (in terms of type:
division, brigade, etc.) unit prevails. (Use the Stacking Points to determine
the "Jargest" unit.) When determining any adjustments to Morale through
Cohesion Level, if there is more than one "largest unit", then the Cohesion
Levels of all "largest units" are added together and divided by the number of
contributing counters.

Example: Three brigades are assaulting an enemy unit. The Cohesion Level of the
Brigades is -4, -1 and +3, respectively. The Player adds the three together
(-4 + (-)1 + 3 = -2, and then divides by three (-2 + 3 = -1, rounding to the
nearest whole number). The Cohesion Level for that battle is thus -1.

[#6_28]*[6.28]* If a Parent Formation has many units within it that have
different Cohesion Levels the largest unit within the Parent Formation
prevails, as per Case <<6_27>>.

*Example*: An extreme example, and one not likely to occur, is one where a
Parent Formation has three Brigades, all with different Cohesion Levels; in
addition, one of the Brigades contains three battalions, each with a different
Cohesion Level. The Cohesion Level for the latter Brigade would have to be
determined before averaging the three Brigades to get the final Cohesion Level.
Again, this will rarely, if ever, occur. 

[#6_29]*[6.29]* Notwithstanding anything said in <<6_27>> or <<6_28>>, each
unit's Cohesion Level is kept track of individually. As most units ina Parent
Formation will have the same level at all times, this will not prove to be too
big a problem. 

[#6_3] 
=== CAPABILITY POINT COST SUMMARY

(see Charts and Tables)

[#7_0] 
== INITIATIVE 

GENERAL RULE:

Initiative is an abstract, numerical rating represen tative of the strategic
leadership capabilities of a given army. It is used, in the game, to determine
who has the choice to act first within a given Operations Stage. The fact that a
Player has the ability to choose when he will move is a great advantage, and the
army with better initiative will often find that it has the upper hand
operationally — if not materially.

[#7_1] 
=== THE MECHANICS OF INITIATIVE

[#7_11]*[7.11]* The Player who has "Initiative" for a Game-Turn may choose
whether he wishes to move first or last in a given Operations Stage.

[#7_12]*[7.12]* The Player who will have the Initiative is determined at the
beginning of each Game-Turn (not Operation Stage). The Player who gains the
Initiative keepts that Initiative for all three Operations Stages in that
Game-Turn. Thus, the Player with Initiative may choose to move first in the
first Operations Stage, last in the second stage and then first in the third
Stage (which would give him, in effect, two "turns" ina row).

[#7_13]*[7.13]* Each side possesses an Initiative Rating (<<7_2>>), which is
dependent on the date of the GameTurn.

[#7_14]*[7.14]* To determine which Player has the Initiative for a given
Game-Turn, each Player, in the Initiative Determinate Stage, rolls one die and
adds his Initiative Rating to the result of the thrown die. The Player with the
highest total (ties roll again) gains the Initiative. Thus, in October of 1940,
if the Italian Player, with an Initiative Rating of '1', were to roll a '4',
and the Commonwealth Player, with an Initiative Rating of '3', were to roll a
'1', the Italian Player would gain the Initiative by virtue of having a total
of five (1 + 4 = 5) to the Commonwealth total of '4' (3 + 1 = 4). The Italian
Player would now be able to choose, in his Initiative Declaration Phase,
whether he wants to move first or last in the Operations Stage for each of
three Operations Stages in the Game-Turn.

[#7_15]*[7.15]* The Player with Initiative for the first Game-Turn of a given scenario
is usually predetermined, Check the individual scenarios for who has the
Initiative for the first Game-Turn.

[#7_16]*[7.16]* For purposes of the Sequence of Play, the Player who moves
first in an Operations Stage is called "Player A"; the Player who moves last
in an Operations Stage is called "Player B".

[#7_2] 
=== INITIATIVE RATINGS CHART

This chart lists the Axis and CW initiative ratings for all units at any given
point in the game. (See Separate Sheets)

[#8_0] 
== LAND MOVEMENT

GENERAL RULE:

In CNA, Land Movementis a function of the CPA of a unit. Most Movement occurs
during the Movement Segment of the Movement/Combat Phase. During the Movement
Segment, the Phasing Player (i.e., the Player who is in the process of moving)
may move as many or as few of his units as he wishes. They may be moved in any
direction or combination of directions, limited only by their CPA's, enemy
Zones of Control, Terrain restrictions and, in the case of motorized units,
Fuel consumption and Breakdown. Under certain conditions (Reaction and Retreat
Before Assault) the non-Phasing Player may move his units.

PROCEDURE:

Units are moved one at a time, or in stacks, tracing a path of contiguous hexes
through the hex grid. As a unit enters each hex it must expend a portion of its
CPA for entering that hex or crossing a particular hexside. All terrain costs
are listed on the Terrain Effects Chart (8.37). In addition to Movement costs,
Players must pay attention to Breakdown costs for vehicles moving through
certain hexes (see Section 21.0).

[#8_1]
=== HOW TO MOVE UNITS

[#8_11]*[8.11]* Units may be moved voluntarily only during the Movement
Segments or Retreat Before Assault Step. Voluntary movement may never take
place out of the Sequence of Play. Players should note that while Player A may
be the Phasing Player, Player B has several opportunities to move his units
during A's Segment. All movement, of any type, expends CP's. Furthermore, if
the unit moving is a vehicle (armored units, selfpropelled artillery and
trucks), the Player must check for possible Breakdown (see Section 21.0). Units
may move freely through Friendly units, with the exception of movement along
roads and tracks (see <<8_34>>).

[#8_12]*[8.12]* Under certain conditions — usually combat — a unit may be forced
to Retreat. This is considered involuntary movement, in that the retreating
Player does not move by his own choice but rather as a direct result of combat.
However, involuntary movement also requires expenditure of CP's and checks for
Breakdown.

[#8_13]*[8.13]* A unit may never enter a hex containing an enemy unit (see,
however, Case 27.4). Furthermore, movement from hex to hex must be con secutive;
units may not skip hexes. (There are, of course, different rules for aircraft.)

[#8_14]*[8.14]* If a unit moves into an enemy Zone of Control (10.0) it must
stop immediately. It may move no further in that Movement Segment and will
probably have to attack, in some form, the enemy unit exerting that Zone of
Control.

[#8_15]*[8.15]* A unit that begins a Movement Segment in an enemy Zone of
Control may move out of that hex and continue movement under the following
conditions:

1. It may not move directly into an enemy Zone of Control (however, see 
<<10_24>>); and

2. It must pay a cost of two CP's if the units are in "Contact" (see <<8_62>>);
or

3. It must pay a cost of four CP's if the units are "Engaged" (see <<8_63>>).

[#8_16]*[8.16]* Units may continue to move and fight as long as they wish, with
certain restrictions (see <<8_2>>). They may exceed their CPA in an Operations
Stage; however this will affect their Cohesion Level.

[#8_17]*[8.17]* Non-motorized units — those units with CPA's of fen or less —
may never voluntarily expend CP's greater than 50% of their base CPA during
their portion of the Operations Stage (An '8' could not go higher than '12', a
'10' no higher than '15'). Remember, Reaction and Retreat Before Assault are
not voluntary movement in your own portion of an Operations Stage; they occur
in the other player's portion of the Operations Stage. Furthermore, no unit
with a Cohesion Level of — 26 or worse may move.

[#8_18]*[8.18]* Second and Third Line Trucks (i.e., Truck Convoys; see 
<<8_9>>) have their own Movement Phase: The Truck Convoy Movement Phase. Such
trucks may not move (voluntarily) in the normal movement segments. Only trucks
directly attached to, and part of, a combat unit or HQ may move in the normal
Movement Segments. Trucks become attached and/or detached in the Organization
Segment of the Sequence of Play.

[#8_19]*[8.19]* No Commonwealth Land unit may be moved west of Marble Arch
(A2109) at any time, for any reason. (This solves a great number of playing
problems, and also reflects Commonwealth operations considerations and
strategy.)

[#8_2]
=== THE CONCEPT OF CONTINUAL MOVEMENT

CNA uses a concept called "Continual Movement". Under this concept a given
unit does not possess a set Movement Allowance which it may never exceed, as in
most wargames. Rather a unit has a Capability Point Allowance. If a Phasing
Player wishes to push his units past their CPA he may do so, knowing that it
will affect that unit's Cohesion. In Continual Movement a unit may continue to
move after it has engaged in combat, moving and fighting as long as the Phasing
Player wishes, within certain limits.

Continual Movement generates certain problems in terms of Time-and-Space
Relationships. The rules attempt to account for the fact that time passes while
one unit is moving; that other units are not standing still.

[#8_21]*[8.21]* Units are not limited as to the number of times they may move
and engage in combat during a given Operations Stage except for Cases 6.26,

8.17, and 8.23. Thus, a unit may move adjacent to an Enemy unit, engage it in
combat, move away (or stay), engage the same or another unit in combat, etc.,
as the Phasing Player wishes. The unit simply expends CP's for a//actions it
performs.

[#8_22]*[8.22]* Within a given Movement/Combat Phase there may be several
segments of Movement and Combat. These are, to a certain extent, regimented. In
essence, the Phasing Player moves his units. He then, after all such movement
is completed, resolves any combat. He may then again move any of his units
(within the exceptions mentioned in 8.21); after all movement at that time is
completed any combat necessitated or desired is resolved. This cycle is
repeated until the Phasing Player no longer wishes to move his units or have
combat. Remember, no combat occurs until a@// movement has ceased within each
Sequence of Movement and Combat.

[#8_23]*[8.23]* Only those Phasing units that have finished a Movement Segment
within two hexes of an enemy unit are free to move again. A Phasing unit that
finishes its movement more than two hexes from an enemy combat unit may not
continue to move during that Movement Phase, regardless of the number of CP's
remaining, unless that is a unit that has been placed in Reserve Status (18.0).
Players should note that Reserve Status is an exception to 8.22.

[#8_24]*[8.24]* A Phasing unit that begins any Movement/Combat Phase in the
Zone of Control of an Enemy unit must expend fwo CP's to break "Contact" — or
four CP's, if such position was brought about by an "Engaged" result on the
Assault CRT — if it wishes to move. (Note, that in the case of an Engaged
result, the presence of an enemy ZOC does not matter.)

[#8_25]*[8.25]* A Friendly unit may attack a given Enemy unit more than once in
a given Operations Stage, with neither unit ever moving! However, each combat
occurs after all movement of other units cease. If there is no movement by any
units, combat may still proceed for as long as the Phasing Player wishes,
providing he has the necessary Ammunition and wishes to expend the required
number of CP's.

[#8_3] 
=== TERRAIN EFFECTS ON MOVEMENT

[#8_31]*[8.31]* Units expend a varying number of CP's to enter hexes or cross certain
hexsides, depending upon the type of unit and/or what type of hex or hexside is
involved. The costs range from % CP for roads (for motorized units) to + 8 for
a vehicle to move down an escarpment via a track or an infantry-type unit to
cross The Nile without a "bridge". See the Terrain Effects Chart for all
effects (8.9).

[#8_32]*[8.32]* Certain types of hexes and/or hexsides are prohibited to
certain types of units. E.g., certain vehicles may never enter a Salt Marsh
hex, unless it is onaroad or track.

[#8_33]*[8.33]* Roads and Tracks may be used to facilitate movement through terrain
obstacles and speed movement over the entire game-map. For a unit to gain any
benefit from movement on a Road or Track if must move from one Road/Track hex
directly into an adjacent, connecting Road/Track hex through a Road/Track
hexside. Units which are moving along Roads or Tracks ignore, for movement
purposes, any other terrain in the hex or hexside, with the exception of
vehicles crossing Escarpments (see 8.42).

[#8_34]*[8.34]* A unit comprised (at least in part) of vehicles (i.e., tanks,
trucks, artillery, etc.) that is moving along a Road or Track is limited in its
ability to move through other Friendly units on the Road or Track in that hex;
see <<9_33>>. Such

moving units may always pass around Friendly units that are on a Road or Track
by moving through the terrain in the hex, i.e., bypassing the units on the road
by moving off the road and around them, going back on the road in the next hex.

[#8_35]*[8.35]* Most of the terrain in CNA is selfexplanatory, especially when
the Terrain Effects Chart is consulted. However, at this point it would help to
be able to visualize the difference between slopes, ridges and escarpments. An
idealized sideview of each of the above types of terrain is provided below so
that players can see what is being abstracted:

[note]
====
Here goes a diagram
====

_Slopes and Escarpments_ always have an "up" side and a
"down" side (see the Terrain Key). The splash contours of the respective
terrain symbols are always on the "down" side of the slope or escarpment.
Thus, when a unit is crossing a slope or escarpment hexside it is moving either
up the slope/escarpment or down the slope/escarpment.

_Ridges_ have no "direction"; crossing a Ridge hexside has the same effect
regardless of which direction the unit is coming from. In essence, ridges are
two-sided slopes.

[#8_36]*[8.36]* Certain types of terrain restrict combat or give the attacker
or defender a combat benefit. These benefits are discussed throughout the
sections on Combat, but they are all summarized on the Terrain Effects Chart.

[#8_37]*[8.37] Terrain Effects Chart*

(see Charts and Tables)

[#8_4] 
=== SPECIAL TERRAIN EFFECTS ON MOVEMENT

For those gamers used to Panzerarmee Afrika and Afrika Korps, the game-map of
CNA will come as something of a shock and a revelation: there is terrain in all
those empty spaces. And much of this terrain is unlike that of anywhere else on
earth, bringing with it special problems for both designer and player. The most
important of these are discussed below.

[#8_41]*[8.41]* _Wadis_. Wadis are, in essence, dried-out river beds. There are
several major areas of wadis in North Africa. While the series of wadis that
"guards"  the Libyan Sand Desert, south of Cyrenaica, is the largest group,
perhaps the most important series of wadis are those extending like fingers from
the Jebel Akhdar (game-map B).  Along with the other difficult terrain in the
area, the wadis of the Jebel Akhdar greatly hinder rapid movement.

All units expend CP's to cross a Wadi hexside. (All wadis in CNA have been
placed along hexsides, with the exception of the Wadi Natrun, just west of the
Nile Delta, which is treated, for gamepurposes, as if it were Salt Marsh.) In
addition, there is a Breakdown Factor of eight for vehicles crossing a wadi
hexside. Roads negate wadis for movement purposes, while Tracks halve the cost
to cross. Vehicles crossing a Wadi on a Road use the Road Breakdown Rate (2
BP), while vehicles crossing on Tracks garner four BP's, not eight.

Players should note that in an Operations Stage in which the Weather is
Rainstorm wadis in affected map sections are impassable at ail points, except
where they are traversed by roads. The cost to cross a rain-swollen wadi by Road
is +2 CP's; there is no additional Breakdown cost (i.e., it is still 1/2 BP).

[#8_42]*[8.42]* _Escarpments_. The escarpments, which were such an integral part
of the Desert Campaign, are at the edge of the Libyan Plateau, which rises from
the edge of the strip of land that borders the Mediterranean. In some places
the rise is gradual; in others it is sharp and severe, virtually uncrossable by
vehicles. Movement costs for crossing escarpment hexsides are listed in the
Terrain Effects Chart (<<8_37>>). However, other factors must be noted. No vehicle
may ever move "up" an escarpment (i.e., cross an escarpment hexside by
moving from the down side to the up side). If a Track crosses an escarpment
hexside, vehicles may use the Track to move down the escarpment, but never up.
The cost for moving down via Track would be +8 CP's and six Breakdown Points.

[#8_43]*[8.43]* Slopes and Ridges. These were discussed in <<8_35>>. All units may
cross these hexsides at a variety of Movement and Breakdown costs; see <<8_37>>.

[#8_44]*[8.44]* _Salt Marsh_. Salt marshes are depressions consisting of very
fine and treacherous salty sand —a veritable quicksand grave for vehicles, and
no fun for infantry either. Vehicles, except for Light Trucks, Recce-type
units, and motorcycle infantry may enter or leave a Salt Marsh hex only on a
Road or Track. A prohibited vehicle that enters a Salt Marsh hex without using
the Track, whatever the reason, is Abandoned (see <<5_33>>). Because most vehicles
are prohibited from entering Salt Marshes in a normal manner, no motorized unit
or AFV (tank, armored car, etc.) may ever engage in Assault with units
defending in a Salt Marsh hex. The one camel unit in the game (the Italian
Meharisti Camel Cavalry) travels as infantry in non-track Salt Marsh hexes, as
these hexes could not support /oaded camels.

[#8_45]*[8.45]* _Desert_. Desert hexes, which comprise the area known as the
Libyan Sand Desert, contain soft, shifting sand (as opposed to "Clear" hexes,
which have a clay-like substance more supportive of vehicular traffic.) Desert
hexes are forbidden to Light Trucks, Motorcycle infantry, and motorcycle Recce
units whose weight was not sufficient enough to provide the traction necessary
for moving vehicles through the soft surface. Such units may not enter any
Desert hexes, whether traversed by Tracks or not. See 8.37 for all terrain
costs.

[#8_46]*[8.46]* _Tracks_. The major communication network of the North African
Plateau is the series of tracks that criss-cross the entire area. The tracks
are useful not in that they are easier to walk or ride in (in some places they
are no easier than the terrain in the hex); what they do provide is direction
— i.e., which way to go. Sense of direction in the "desert" is almost
non-existent; the tracks provide that. Movement along tracks is at 1 CP per hex
and halves most hexside crossing CP costs. In addition, units using a track pay
only one-half the normal Breakdown cost for that hex.

[#8_47]*[8.47]* _Railroads and Roads_. The use of these two are discussed quite
succinctly in the body of the rules. However, Players should note that, on the
game-map, there are large sections of railroad and some' roads that are not
constructed as of September 1940 and must be constructed to exist. Specific
later scenarios will list the hexes that have been constructed by that time.
Unconstructed railroad hexes are ignored for all purposes. Unconstructed roads
are treated as tracks.

[#8_48]*[8.48]* _Oases_ do not affect movement, But it might be worthwhile to
point out here that Oases are considered to be nondiminishing Supply Dumps for
Water and Stores.

[#8_49]*[8.49]* All of these terrain types also affect combat. However, such
effects are discussed in the various combat Sections, especially <<15_3>>.

[#8_5] 
=== REACTION

Reaction is the capability of a unit to "get out of the way" of an attacking
unit or units before the enemy can launch an attack against the reacting unit.
Reaction is movement conducted by the nonPhasing Player — as defender — in the
opposing Player's Movement/Combat Phase, A unit's ability to react is limited
to certain specific situations. Reaction expends CP's.

[#8_51]*[8.51]* Reaction is the process of movement by a Friendly, non-Phasing
unit in response to an Enemy Combat unit moving adjacent to that Friendly,
non-Phasing combat unit. Reaction follows all the standard rules of movement,
except as stated below.

[#8_52]*[8.52]* A given unit may React as many times as the Player wishes
during an Operations Stage. A unit "reacting" expends CP's; however, it does
not expend CP's for Breaking Contact/Engaged, as defined in <<8_24>>.

[#8_53]*[8.53]* All units may react, with the following exceptions:

a. Non-motorized units, Squadron Ground Support Units, and Truck Convoys not
stacked with Friendly combat units may never React.

b. No unit may React if the Enemy unit moving adjacent to it has a CPA six or
more points greater than that of the non-Phasing unit and the owner of the
Phasing unit announces there will be a Close Assault by his unit against the
non-Phasing unit. Thus, a motorized infantry battalion may react when a tank
battalion with a CPA of 25 moves adjacent to it, because a motorized unit will
have a minimum CPA of 20 (from its trucks). However, if the same motorized
battalion were to be moved adjacent to by an enemy Recce battalion, with a CPA
of 45, the motorized battalion could not React. (It could still Retreat Before
Assault, however; see <<13_0>>). Furthermore, each units is treated
individually; thus, Second Line Light Trucks stacked with (but not attached to)
that motorized battalion could retreat (as they have an extended CPA of 40,
only 5 less than 45). 

c. If a non-phasing unit is already in an enemy Zone of Control (usually as a
result of (b) above) it may not React. In this way, faster units "pin" slower
units.

d. A unit that is in combat or Engaged may not react.

[#8_54]*[8.54]* Notwithstanding anything said in <<8_53>>, no battalion size unit
may ever pin a division and no company-size unit may ever pin a brigade or
larger unit. The terms used here refer to size, and not specifically the unit
type/designation. Size of unit may be determined by Stacking Points as well as
the TOE. Thus a division may be but a skeleton force, as may other units. The
problem should rarely occur, as most units are fairly easy to determine as to
size and type, but if there is a question use your Common Sense (or flip a coin
if that commodity is in short supply). See <<9_2>>.

[#8_55]*[8.55]* Reacting units may never enter an Enemy Zone of Control during
their Reaction Movement. Otherwise, Reaction is undertaken like normal
movement, with no limit as to how far a unit may React/Move.

[#8_56]*[8.56]* A unit may react, within the restrictions listed in <<8_53>> above,
even if it is attached to a parent formation. In this case, the CP is expended
for detachment and the unit may then react. A brigade HQ may not be detached
from a division unless all of the units at present attached to the brigade HQ
are also detached. In addition, the

detachment of units may not be performed such that the parent unit is vow
"pinned" as a result of its becoming a shell and having <<8_54>> now apply.
Attached trucks may be freely divided amongst the parent unit and its detaching
and reacting units. Note that this rule does nor permit a parent unit to detach
low CPA units in order for the parent unit to now be able to react.

[#8_6] 
=== BREAKING OFF

[#8_61]*[8.61]* Breaking Off is a function of Movement that occurs when a unit
beings a Friendly Movement Segment in Contact or Engaged with an Enemy Combat
unit. Contact and Engaged markers are provided to indicate such status. (There
has been some discussion of this in <<8_24>>; see also Case <<15_81>>).

[#8_62]*[8.62]* Units are in Conract if they are inan Enemy Zone of Control at
the beginning of a Movement Segment.

[#8_63]*[8.63]* Units are Engaged directly as a result of Close Assault;
Engaged is a combat result. Engaged units do not necessarily have to be in
Enemy Zones of Control. ,

[#8_64]*[8.64]* A unit in Contact or Engaged with an Enemy combat unit at the
beginning of a Movement Segment or a Retreat Before Assault (not Reaction) may
not move until it has paid a cost in CP's to break off such contact. In
addition, First Line Trucks wishing to detach from an Engaged or Contacted
parent unit must expend the necessary CP's to so detach. Second/Third Line
Trucks wishing to attach as First Line Trucks to Engaged or Contacted units do
not expend additional CP's to so attach,

[#8_65]*[8.65]* A unit in Contact must expend two CP's to Break Off before
moving.

[#8_66]*[8.66]* A unit that is Engaged must expend four CP's to Break Off
before moving.

[#8_67]*[8.67]* When all of the Friendly units that were in Contact or Engaged
with an Enemy combat unit Break Off that Enemy unit is no longer Engaged or in
Contact.

[#8_68]*[8.68]* Contact and Engaged markers affect only the combat units in the
hex at the time of their placement. Units moving into a hex with a Contact or
Engaged marker are not affected by that marker.

[#8_7] 
=== RAIL MOVEMENT OF LAND UNITS

[#8_71]*[8.71]* There are two rail lines in the game. The Alexandria-Mersa
Matruh line is an active railroad. It may be extended by construction (see 
<<24_6>>) and may be used only by the Commonwealth Player, regardless of the
strategic situation. The Soluch-Benghazi-Barce rail line is on the gamemap
solely for historical purposes; it may not be used for anything and has no
effect whatsoever on terrain or movement. (It was used by the Italians in 1940,
but not in any way as to affect the game.)

[#8_72]*[8.72]* The Commonwealth Player may use Rail Movement once per
Operations Stage, in the Commonwealth Rail Movement Phase. He may transport
units and/or supplies, and he may move one "stack" of these any distance along
the rail line in each direction. Thus, a unit may be moved west from Alexandria
to any rail hex along a finished rail line as far as (eventually) Tobruk, and
supplies in Tobruk may be moved east to Matruh.

[#8_73]*[8.73]* To use Rail Movement a unit must start the Operations Stage on a
rail hex, it may not have expended any CP's for any other reason during that
Operations Stage, and it may not be in an Enemy ZOC. The unit is then moved to
the desired point along the line where it stops. It may not enter an Enemy ZOC
or Enemy-occupied hex at any time while using Rail Movement.
