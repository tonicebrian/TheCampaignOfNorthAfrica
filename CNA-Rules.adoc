*Read This First*

The rules of this SPI simulation game are organized in a format known as the *Case System*. This system of organization divides the rules into *Major Sections* (each of which deals with an important aspect of play). These Sections are numbered sequentially as well as being named.

Each of these Major Sections is introduced by a *General Rule*, which briefly describes the subject of the Section. Many times this General Rule is followed by a *Procedure*, which describes the basic action the player will take when using the rules in that Section. Finally, the bulk of each Major Section consists of *Cases*. These are the specific detailed rules that actually regulate play.

Each of these Cases is also numbered. The numbering follows a logical system based upon the number of the Major Section of which the Cases are a part. A Case with the number `6.5`, for example, is the fifth Primary Case of the sixth Major Section of the rules. Many times these Primary Cases are further subdivided into *Secondary Cases*. A Secondary Case is recognizable by the fact that it has two digits to the right of its decimal point.

Each Major Section can have as many as nine Primary Cases, and each Primary Case can have as many as nine Secondary Cases. The numbering system is meant as an organizational aid. Using it, players can always easily tell where a Case is located in the rules. As a further aid, an outline of the Major Sections and Primary Cases is given at the beginning of the rules

*How the Section and Case Numbers Work*

* Major Section Number
* Primary Case Number
* Secondary Case Number

Example:

----
6.531
----

The preceding example would be the number of the third Secondary Case of the fifth Primary Case of the sixth Major Section of the rules.

*How to Learn to Play the Game*

Familiarize yourself with all of the components. Read all of the General Rules and Procedures and read the titles of the Primary Cases. Set up the game for play (after reading the pertinent Section) and play a trial game against yourself, referring to the rules only when you have a question.

This procedure may take you a few hours, but it is the fastest and most entertaining way to learn the rules short of having a friend teach them to you.

You should not attempt to learn the rules word-for-word. Memorizing all that detail is a task of which few of us are capable. SPI rules are written to be as complete as possible—they are not designed to be memorized. The Case numbering system makes it easy to look up rules when you are in doubt.

Absorbing the rules in this manner (as you play) is a much better approach to game mastery than attempting to study them as if cramming for a test.

We hope you enjoy this SPI game. Should you have any difficulty interpreting the rules, please write to SPI, phrasing your questions so that they can be answered by a simple sentence, word, or number. You must enclose a stamped, self-addressed envelope. We cannot guarantee a proper answer should you choose to phone in your question (the right person is not always available, and since SPI has published hundreds of games, no one individual is capable of answering all questions).

== Introduction

*The Campaign for North Africa* (CNA) is a simulation of actual operations in Libya and Egypt from 1940 through early 1943. CNA was designed as a definitive simulation intended for the sophisticated wargamer and the serious student of history. As such, CNA is the most logistically oriented game ever designed and may be considered by some to be overly complex.

In fact, the game system itself is quickly absorbed, and most experienced players will have little problem understanding how to play the game. At the same time, there is a ferocious amount of information for the players to digest and use. The assimilation and coordination of all this information is what makes CNA so formative, challenging, and (hopefully) enlightening. Very little has been abstracted; CNA contains more hard information on the subject than any other single source encountered by the SPI design staff.

CNA is not a game for one, two, or even three players. This is a multi-player game in the true sense of the word. For maximum playability and efficiency, it is recommended that, on each side, one person be assigned to Logistics, one person to Air Forces command, and at least three players to Land Forces command (again, per side). It is also strongly suggested that at least one calculator be available.

Although the rules are quite long, CNA is relatively easy to explain. Someone familiar with the rules can tell other players how to play with remarkable ease.

Each hex represents approximately eight kilometers; each Game-Turn represents one week of “real" time. Units range in size from companies (approximately 100 men) to divisions (approximately 15,000 men).

== How to Play the Game

====
*Commentary*

This Section serves as an orientation for the prospective player (or rules reader), providing a basic overview of what is involved in the game and how it is organized.
====

=== Organization of the Rules and How They Should Be Read

<<2_0>> is divided into three parts. The second part discusses how the game is set up. The third part explains how the game is actually played. Everything is explained in very general terms; the intention is to orient the reader rather than to teach detailed procedures.

<<3_0>> is a glossary intended to explain terms used during play and their relationships to one another. The glossary should be reviewed before the rest of the rules, although some definitions will not become fully clear until the relevant sections are read.

<<4_0>> describes the game equipment and details how the game should be set up.

<<5_0>> contains the *Sequence of Play*, which outlines a single Game-Turn. <<1_0>> through <<5_0>> are written to familiarize the player with game terms and the overall system of play.

<<6_0>> through <<32_0>> include all rules necessary to play the *Land Game*. The Land Game uses abstracted and relatively simple supply rules and very simple air power rules.

<<33_0>> through <<47_0>> encompass the *Air Game*, which involves individual aircraft and pilots and the effects of their presence.

<<48_0>> through <<58_0>> constitute the *Logistics Game*, which replaces the abstract supply rules used if the Land Game is played alone. It is possible to play the Land Game by itself, to combine the Land and Air Games, or to combine the Logistics Game with either or both of the other games.

<<59_0>> through <<65_0>> describe the five *Scenario Groups*. One Scenario is the full Campaign Game, covering the entire campaign from September 1940 (the Italian invasion of Egypt) onward. Other Scenarios are smaller slices of the campaign that can be played to a decision in considerably less time.

=== How the Game Is Set Up

There are two basic and vital prerequisites for playing CNA: *time* and *people*.

Preparing to play CNA requires considerable effort, both in preparing the game
components and in planning strategies and organizing a workable division of
labor and logistics system.

Unlike many other SPI games, the counters on the map do not contain all the
information required to play. Players must keep track, on paper, of many details
concerning the status of their units, including (but not limited to) current
strength, attached subsidiary units, morale level, supply status, water, fuel,
ammunition, and stores.

Setting up the game involves compiling information for each unit required by the
Scenario. Provided with the game are three TOE Log Sheets designed to store this
information. Each type of Log Sheet corresponds to a specific type or size of
unit. Players will need to create additional Log Sheets by copying or designing
their own. One Log Sheet is required for each counter on the map.

Players should also ensure they have plenty of pencils (with erasers), scratch paper, and stamina.

=== How to Run a Game of CNA

CNA is a logistically oriented game and requires not only attention to logistics
but also a logistically sound methodology of play.

Playtesting indicates that the optimal number of players is eight to ten—four to
five per side. Fewer than four creates excessive workload; more than five slows
decision-making.

Clear division of responsibilities is critical. Teams that communicate
effectively consistently outperform technically proficient but poorly
coordinated teams. The standard division of responsibilities is:

*Commander-in-Chief*:: Overall intelligence and dissemination of information; strategic decisions; resolving disputes; planning raids and special actions.
*Logistics Commander*:: All supplies; transport from Italy or Britain to North Africa; supply dumps; Third-Line Trucks; some Second-Line Trucks; naval convoys (Axis).
*Rear Area Commander*:: Supply and reinforcements to the front; rear-area security; reserves; prisoners; construction; some Second-Line Trucks.
*Air Commander*:: Aircraft and pilots; planning and execution of air missions; deployment of air bases.
*Front-Line Commander*:: Execution of attacks; coordination of defenses; front-line troop movement.

For effective play, each commander must perform competently and communicate clearly. Failures in coordination can quickly lead to disaster.

=== Playing Time

Playing the entire *Campaign for North Africa* requires at least 1,200 hours of
play time, likely more. Each Game-Turn takes approximately ten hours, although
less time may be required during turns with limited movement or combat. This is
a long game. Individual Game-Turns may occasionally be completed in two hours,
but such speed usually occurs only when both sides are logistically exhausted.
The length of play is deliberate: the level of involvement allows players to
make virtually all of the operational and strategic decisions that the original
commanders were required to make.

== Glossary and Unit Definitions

[#3_1]
=== Definitions of Terms

*Cohesion Level*::
A measure of how combat-effective a unit is at a given point in time. Cohesion is affected by acquiring Reorganization Points and by receiving Disorganization Points.

*Combat Air Patrol (CAP)*::
Offensive CAP involves searching for and intercepting enemy aircraft. Defensive CAP involves escorting friendly aircraft.

*Combat Unit*::
Any unit capable of engaging enemy units and/or aircraft in combat. Headquarters, Engineers, and Dummy Tank Formations are considered combat units in certain situations.

*Combined Arms Attack*::
A Close Assault in which tanks must be supported by at least an equal number of infantry units. If not, tank combat values are reduced.

*Desert Raider*::
A special company-sized unit operating in jeeps, capable of limited movement and combat and normally unobserved by the opposing player.

*Reaction*::
A unit's ability to evade combat. This is directly related to the degree of motorization or mechanization of the unit.

*Efficiency Level*::
A unit's ability to embark and disembark troops, equipment, and supplies, and to withstand damage.

*Engineering Capability*::
The ability of a Headquarters unit to construct or demolish game items. Includes Anti-Aircraft units, certain artillery types, and Anti-Tank units when assigned.

*Gun*::
An artillery or anti-tank weapon represented either independently or as part of a unit.

*Sequential Dice Roll*::
A dice roll using two dice read as a two-digit number from 11 through 66. The larger die provides the tens digit; the smaller die provides the ones digit.

*Headquarters (HQ)*::
A unit composed of independent subsidiary units (including trucks), represented either by a counter or by separate counters.

*Shell Unit*::
A combat unit possessing fewer than the minimum number of TOE Strength Points and/or subsidiary units.

*Barrage*::
An attack that negates the requirement for adjacent friendly units to conduct a Close Assault against the target enemy unit.

*Initiative*::
The side (Axis or Allied) that determines which player acts first in each Operations Stage of the Campaign Turn.

*Involuntary Movement*::
Movement forced upon a unit as a result of a Retreat outcome from Close Assault combat.

*Log Sheet*::
A paper record used to track specific information and status for a unit. One Log Sheet is required for each counter on the map.

*Maneuver Element*::
Those forces within a division or brigade normally responsible for offensive ground combat (primarily tank and infantry units).

*Morale*::
The ability and willingness of troops to fight. All combat units possess a Basic Morale Rating, which may be improved through successful combat.

*Motorized Unit*::
A unit whose movement is provided by wheeled or tracked vehicles. Some units are always motorized; others may alternate between motorized and foot movement.

*Organization Size*::
The scale of a unit, measured in Division-, Brigade-, Battalion-, or Company-Equivalents (Eq).

*Organization at Arrival Chart (OA Chart)*::
A chart listing the arrival date, original composition, and initial strength of each unit entering play.

*Parent Unit*::
A counter representing a larger unit that contains or controls smaller assigned or attached units.

*Pinned*::
A possible result of Air Bombardment or Barrage. A pinned unit may not voluntarily move or initiate combat for the remainder of the current sub-Phase and is placed in Reserve.

*Ready Aircraft*::
Aircraft that have been armed, fueled, and refitted and are prepared to fly and perform missions.

*Reinforcement*::
A unit that does not begin on the map but enters play at a specified later time.

*Replacement*::
Personnel and equipment used to rebuild destroyed units or increase the effectiveness of existing units.

*Squadron Ground Support Unit (SGSU)*::
The headquarters and support unit responsible for aircraft operations.

*Stacking Point*::
A measure of the space a unit occupies in a hex or along a road or track during movement.

*Supplies*::
Consumable resources: Ammunition, Fuel, Stores, and Water.

*TOE Strength Point*::
A measure of manpower and equipment. Roughly equivalent to 100 men, 5–8 armored vehicles, or 4–8 guns.

*Transport Unit*::
A counter capable of expending Capability Points to move supplies or other units.

*Upgrading*::
The process of increasing a combat unit's effectiveness.

*Zone of Control (ZOC)*::
The area of influence surrounding a combat unit. Enemy units must stop upon
entering a hex in an opposing ZOC. CNA uses a rigid, active ZOC system.

[#3_2]
=== Unit Differentiation

[#3_21]
*[3.21]* Units are differentiated into the following categories:

* Infantry-Type
* Tank-Type
* Reconnaissance-Type
* Anti-Tank-Type
* Anti-Aircraft-Type
* Artillery-Type
* Engineer-Type
* Aircraft-Type
* Ground Support Units
* Recovery Squadrons
* Dummy Tank Formations
* Trucks

The counters representing each type are listed in the Counter Manifest <<4_2>>,
except for Dummy Tank Formations, which have no counters.

[#3_22]
*[3.22]* For Barrage and aircraft attacks (Strafing and Bombardment), units are grouped into the following classes:

Infantry-class: All Infantry-Type, Engineers,
Headquarters possessing a defensive Close Assault
Rating but not possessing an Armor Protection
Rating, SGSU, and Recce-Type that do not
possess an Armor Protection Rating.

Armor-class: All Tank-Type, Dummy Tank Formations, Tank Recovery Squadrons, headquarters
possessing an Armor Protection Rating, RecceType possessing an Armor Protection Rating, and
those Artillery and Anti-tank-Type units possessing an Armor Protection Rating (SPA and Tank
Destroyers).

Gun-class: All Artillery-Type, Anti-aircraft-Type
and Anti-tank-Type units comprised of any TOE
Strength Points not possessing an Armor Protection Rating, includingHQs and infantry with Barrage capability.

Truck-class: All Trucks.

[note]
====
Any Artillery or Anti-tank unit that is comprised of weapons (TOE Strength Points) with an
Armor Protection Rating and of weapons without
one are considered ¢wo units for target purposes.
====

[#3_23]*[3.23]* Combat units consist of all Infantry-Type, Tank-Type Recce-Type,
Artillery-Type, Antitank-Type, and Anti-aircraft-Type units. For certain
determinations, such as Zone of Control, Reconnaissance, Barrage and
Bombardment, certain non-combat units may be considered combat units.

[#3_3]
=== HEADQUARTERS UNITS

HQ's serve two functions: They act as command coordination for the individual
units under them, and they also represent, when on the game-map, all of the
units attached to that HQ.

[#3_31]*[3.31]* HQ units represent all combat units, Trucks (and their
Supplies), etc. attached to that counter. If any combat units are attached, the
HQ counter itself is considered a combat unit, and fights with the combined
strengths of all units in it.

[#3_32]*[3.32]* An HQ (and for that matter, all Parent Units) have a CPA equal
to the CPA of the 'slowest' unit attached to the HQ.

[#3_33]*[3.33]* The Stacking Points printed on the HQ are those of a full
complement of units. Thus a divisional HQ representing an entire division
occupies 5 Stacking Points of space. The rules on unit Equivalents (see
<<9_2>>) discuss what happens if the division operates at less than full strength.
If an HQ has no combat units attached it occupies zero Stacking Points and may
use its parenthesized Ratings. It is no longer considered to be a combat unit
and may not voluntarily attack.

[#3_34]*[3.34]* Certain HQ units, mostly with the Italian Army, have artillery
assigned to regimental HQ's (guns directly under command of the HQ). These HQ's
may use their combat strengths, and losses for the guns are taken as regular
losses. However, when all gun TOE Strength Points are eliminated, the HQ is not
destroyed: it reverts to the status of a non-combat HQ.

[#3_35]*[3.35]* Armored Division and Armored Brigade HQ units usually have a
"platoon" of tanks assigned, as Players will note by the ratings of each such
HQ. These tanks may not be used in combat unless the HQ has no combat units
attached.  Tanks assigned to HQ's may not be transferred to combat units,
regardless of the situation. If such an HQ loses its tanks, they should be
replaced by the first available Tank Replacement Points. HQ's with tanks
attached are not subject to Breakdown.

[#3_36]*[3.36]* An HQ unit that has no combat values, either with or without
parentheses, is captured instantly if it is in a hex without any combat units
and an Enemy combat unit places the HQ in its Zone of Control. There is no
Capability Point expenditure required for such a capture, and the HQ is treated
as one Prisoner Point.

[#3_4]
=== COMBAT UNITS

CNA has a great variety of combat units — more than 25 different types, not
including aircraft.  Although the structure of the game is operational, there
has been an attempt to inject a "tactical" flavor into the game by
differentiating between the functions of the various units. However, players
should keep in mind that this is an operational game, and that many purely
tactical functions have been abstracted or ignored. Below is a brief resume of
the various types of units, noting any exceptions. Some of the completely
familiar units have been omitted.

_Motorized Infantry_: These are infantry units that are usually transported in
Trucks. (The British often called their units Lorried infantry.) Motorized
Infantry units must actually have Trucks in order to use their Motorized CPA
(i.e., that of the Truck). Otherwise they are regular "foot" Infantry. Units
that were usually motorized are so indicated on the units' Characteristics
Charts.

_Mechanized Infantry_: Primarily, these units were not only motorized but also
usually supplied with some Armored Cars, half-tracks, armored Personnel
carriers, etc. Unless there is a terrible and total emergency, Mechanized
Infantry should remain motorized at all times.

_Motorcycle Infantry/Reconnaissance_: These are mostly Italian Bersaglierei
mitraglieri (motorcycle) units (plus two German battalions of Kradschutzen). The
equipment is the popular two-man cycle, plus a few jeeps, Armored Cars, etc.
Weaponry was pretty good, with a high percentage of machineguns; thus their
relatively high firepower. Cycles may not enter hexes prohibited to Light
Trucks. Moreover, even though motorcycles are vehicles, they do not use Fuel nor
do they suffer Breakdown.

_Heavy Weapons Units_: There are several of these units, such as the German
Schwerste-Infanteriegeschutz units. Equipment varied, but often included
machineguns, mortars, some light artillery and anti-tank guns, perhaps a light
AA battery. It varies from unit to unit.

_Garrison Infantry_: These units are virtually the sole property of the Italians
— and they are usually welcome to them. Most Italian Garrison Infantry came from
the GaF Settore di Coperture Regiments, comprised of over-age Italians living in
Libya. Their training was minimal, their spirits low, their performance poor.
However, units labeled as garrison units (with a G on the counter — and this
includes all types of garrison units) stack free in the city or town which they
were originally assigned to garrison. E.g., the 30th GaF infantry units have
zero Stacking Poins when in Bardia. There is one Commonwealth unit which is
considered a Garrison: The Matruh Garrison. The OA Sheet gives specific
instructions on this unit.  unit.

_Airborne Infantry_: These are treated as normal infantry, unless they are
capable of being paradropped, which capability is listed on the Arrival Sheet
for that unit. See <<40_4,[40.4]>>.

_Armored Recce and Armored Car units_: Recce units usually comprise light
armored cars (Bren Carriers, Autoblindas, etc.), while the Armored Car units
have some tanks (Stuarts, PzII's, etc.) and heavier cars. The sole difference is
the fact that Armored Car units are virtually light Tank Battalions. (The
British considered Recce as infantry, but Armored Car as Armored units.) Recce
and AC units have remarkable mobility and are best used to probe and freeze
(Pin) small enemy formations.

_Artillery_: The Artillery units in the game comprise a wide variety of weapons,
from 65mm Infantry guns up to 21cm German howitzers and British <<5_5>>" howitzers.
Some of the minor guns have been ignored or combined into one "piece" with
similar ratings. Italian mortar companies have been melded into the regimental
HQ's and ad hoc artillery units. Ratings for guns and howitzers were based on
Range and Penetration effect, as well as rate of fire and type of shell. Unless
stated otherwise on the Arrival Sheet, all Artillery has its own intrinsic
(built-in) transport, transport which may never be stripped (unless you wish to
abandon the guns).  Artillery units use Fuel (when moving) as well as Water.
However, they are not subject to Breakdown. Players will also note that certain
Artillery units have more than one type of gun (e.g., the 221st Artillery Regt.
of the German 90th Light Division). All guns belong to the same unit and they
are treated as one unit.

_Self-Propelled Artillery_: These are guns mounted on Tank or quasi-tank
chassis. They fire like guns and have Vulnerability Ratings, but they also may
be destroyed by Anti-Tank Fire. Their advantage is in increased mobility and
Assault value. SP Artillery consumes Fuel and Water and _ suffers Breakdown.

_Coastal Defense Guns_: These artillery units always have a CPA of 10 for combat
purposes only, unless they have printed CPAs of greater than ten. They may not
be moved unless Trucks are attached and assigned to that purpose. Guns with a
'0' (not '0+') CPA are emplaced and may never be moved. Emplaced Guns do not
possess a Vulnerability Rating and may be destroyed only by Barrage, Capture or
Air Bombardment. Cost Defense Artillery that is motorized is subject to
Breakdown.

_Anti-Tank Units_: These have "guns" with the ability to pierce armor, thus
destroying tanks and other armored units. There are certain TOE Strength Points,
not specifically anti-tank, that also have this ability: British 25-pdrs., the
famous German 88mm Flak units, Italian 75mm and 90mm AA/Flak units, etc. British
Heavy Antiaircraft units, with <<3_7>>" guns, theoretically had the capability to
fire as anti-tank weapons. However, British doctrine was such that they were
never (well, hardly ever) used in this role. ("If they were meant to be used as
anti-tank guns they would have been called anti-tank guns." Apocryphal, but
true.) Unless self-propelled, anti-tank units are notarmored.

_Anti-Aircraft/Flak Units_: Of all the units in the game, AA/Flak unis suffered
the most liberties in terms of design. The myriad and voluminous AA/Flak
batteries spread over Africa were often combined into larger regiments and
battalions, making the historical battalions/regiments seem larger than they
perhaps were. AA/Flak units comprise a fairly wide section of weapons: British
40mm, as well as the ill-used <<3_7>>"s, German 20 and 88mm's, plus Italian 20mm's,
75's and 90mm's.  Many of these guns had other tactical uses, apart from
shooting down planes. Thus AA/Flak units are given a variety of ratings, most of
them parenthesized. Some units, especially German 88's, can be used in many
roles. These decisions were not based on innate capabilities, but rather on
tactical doctrine and actual usage.

_Units with Parenthesized Strengths_: Certain combat units —and certain
non-combat units— have parenthesized Combat Ratings. These ratings may be used
only if such a unit is in a hex not occupied by Friendly combat units with
appropriate nonparenthesized ratings is attacked by Enemy units.

[#3_5]
=== UNIT CHARACTERISTICS

Each counter comprises a number of TOE Strength Points. The unit's abilities are
those of the TOE Strength Points comprising it (certain counters may exist if
there are no TOE Strength Points in them; these possess only a Capability Point
Allowance). The following is a brief ex- planation of the units'
characteristics:

_Capability Point Allowance (abbr. CPA)_: The unit's ability to execute movement
and combat, stated numerically,

_Barrage Rating_: A combat strength expressing the relative capability of that
unit to inflict damage when firing as an artillery piece (i.e., indirect fire).

_Vulnerability_: A numerical expression of a gun's susceptibility to being
destroyed or captured when in a Forward Position (see <<12_1>>). It is based
mostly on the gun's range and tactical usage doctrine.

_Anti-armor Strength_: A numerical expression of a unit's ability to destroy
armored vehicles.

_Armor Protection Rating_: The ability of an armored vehicle to withstand enemy anti-armor fire.
This is based on the vehicle's armor thickness and excellence of construction.

_Offensive Close Assault Rating_: The ability, stated numerically, of a unit to
engage enemy forces in "hand-to-hand" (i.e., Close Assault) combat.

_Defensive Assault Rating_: The ability, stated numerically, of a unit to defend
against a Close Assault.

_Anti-aircraft Rating_: A numerical expression of a unit's ability to shoot down
aircraft (this ability occurs, aside from anti-aircraft units, only ina few
headquarters, tanks, and other units).

_Maximum TOE Strength_: This is, all things con- sidered, the most important
number on the sheet (see <<4_46>>). It is the numerical expression of the
manpower (for infantry), tank platoons (for armored units), or batteries (for
guns) in that unit.  The infantry manpower figures are based roughly on anywhere
from 100 to 200 men, depending on the combat function of the individual and his
use within the unit. The tank platoons are calculated in groups of five to eight
vehicles. The gun bat- teries are calculated in groups of four guns.

_Basic Morale Rating_: A numerical (and somewhat subjective) expression of a
unit's training, combat experience, and esprit d'corps, on a scale of +3
(excellent) to ""3 (armed rabble with minimal in- terest in anything harmful).
Certain Com- monwealth units must be Trained in order to reach their listed
Basic Morale.

_Fuel Rate_: A simplified reduction of the vehicle's miles per gallon
efficiency.

_Breakdown Adjustment Rating_: An expression, stated numerically, of the general
construction and ease of maintenance of a vehicle coupled with the level of
mechanical competence of the unit per- forming the maintenance.

== GAME EQUIPMENT

[#4_1]
=== THE GAME-MAPS

The game-map takes up a great deal of space (it is almost ten feet in length),
and it is virtually impossible to play any scenario without all the maps.
This is because of the logistical nature of the game and the emphasis on supply
lines and transport.  Players will also find that they will be using areas of
the game-map for dropping counters, piling markers, etc. True, there are areas
of the maps that will remain virtually untouched by combat units. Simply
remember what's in play, and what is just being used. Playtesting of CNA, which
usually took anywhere from six to 12 Players at any given time, revealed, among
other things, that most action took place in one section of the game- maps. It
can get pretty crowded in that area at times, so try to keep your displays and
other information out of harm's way.

For those Players experiencing difficulties, the five Map Sections are labeled A
through E and are laid long side by long side from west to east respectively
(see diagram). The Map Sections should be laid so that the Oixx hexrow of a Map
Section overlays the 39xx hexrow of the Map Section whose letter immediately
preceeds it in the alphabet (that is, Map Section E partially overlays Map
Section D which partially overlays Map Section C, etc.).

[#4_2]
=== THE COUNTERS

There are actually few counters in play at any one given time. However, each
division on the game- map is comprised of a large number of lesser-sized units.
These battalions and brigades might be brought into use at any given time, so
the players should sort their counters into divisions, and organize their
divisions so that they know where the individual units of that division are. It
may even be wise to have a separate table for placement of such units.

[#4_25]*[4.25]* *Counter Deployment*

A unit attached to another unit is not represented by a counter on the game
map.

For example: The First Greek Infantry Brigade Group is comprised of the Ist
Greek Brigade HQ counter, the Ist Greek Field Artillery Regiment counter and the
Ist Greek Infantry, 2nd Greek Infantry and 3rd Greek Infantry Battalions
counters. If the three infantry battalions and the artillery regiment were
attached to the headquarters unit, the entire brigade would be represented on
the game map by the headquarters counter. Unless specifically stated, all
assigned units beginning a scenario in the same hex as their parent unit are
attached to that parent unit. The counters representing said units are therefore
not deployed on the game-map.

[#4_26]*[4.26] Holding Boxes*

Certain hexes on the game-map "attract" a large number of counters. These hexes
are represented by Holding Boxes which are nothing more than large spaces for
deploying all of the counters which are actually located in the hex the Holding
Box is representing.

[#4_3]
=== CHARTS AND TABLES

There are an inordinate number of Charts and Tables in CNA. Most of them can be
found in the Charts and Tables Booklet. However, some are located on separate
loose sheets of paper or printed on the game-map or in the Rules booklets.

[#4_4]
=== ORGANIZATION AND ARRIVAL SYSTEM

In any given scenario, the Players receive units via the Initial Deployment
(given in each scenario) and via the Reinforcement Schedules. In addition to
these, Players may plan for Replacement Points to augment depleted units; the
discussion of these can be found in <<20_2>>. The Cases below give the Players
a base for using and understanding the terminology and location of the terms
and tables for acquiring and using units.

[#4_41]*[4.41]* There are three types of charts which the Player will refer to
in order to gain information on his units. These are the Characteristics Charts,
which show what capabilities and characteristics each unit or unit-type has (in
terms of. ratings and numbers), the "OA" Sheets, which list the organization of
units and arrival dates for each parent unit (usually division), and the
Reinforce- ment Schedules, which list the names and dates of all newly arriving
land units. Air units have separate reinforcement charts and tables which
determine their arrival.

[#4_42]*[4.42]* The following procedure is used to deter- mine which units
arrive during a Game-Turn and the abilities of those arriving units. The Player
consults the appropriate Reinforcement Schedule and determines the current
Operations Stage of the Game-Turn in progress; noting the units arriving, he
finds the OA (Organization at Arrival) Chart for each of those units. Parent
Formations are easy to find (e.g., divisions and brigades); smaller detachments
arriving piecemeal are usually given their parent formation for easy reference
to the correct OA Sheet. Having located the correct OA Sheet for each unit, the
Player notes the Characteristics Code for each individual unit (that has
arrived) in that Parent, and refers to the Characteristics Charts to determine
the capabilities of those units. Each Parent unit arrives with all lesser
units listed on the OA Chart, unless the unit has a later arrival date and/or is
listed as excluded on the Reinforcement Track.  Players should then draw up a
TOE Sheet for each such Parent Formation (and its lesser units). To more clearly
understand the above procedure, Players should at this time run through a sample
turn of Reinforcements, using any turn on the Track. Such a brief examination
will quickly show how this process operates.

[note]
====
The Player is provided with an inter-locking series of charts and tables,
each dependent on the other for information. Although there are a lot of tables
and the profusion may seem confusing, just a brief scanning of these tables and
tracks will be enough to show how they work. Remember, each different table or
track provides a piece of information, and the tables and tracks often contain
information found on the other such tracks or tables for purposes of
cross-checking. Example: The Reinforcement Schedule shows the arrival of the
18th Australian Brigade. The Commonwealth Player, noting that, looks forthe OA
Sheet for the 18th Australian Brigade. The OA Sheet also gives the Arrival Date,
which is a cross-check with the Reinforcement Schedule. The Player now notes the
units within the brigade, their Characteristic Code Letters, and consults the
Unit Characteristics Charts for those units to determine what their capabilities
are. This information is then placed on the TOE Sheet for the 18th Brigade,
along with any other information needed or desired.
====

[#4_43]*[4.43] Reinforcement Schedules*
(see Charts and Tables)

[#4_44]*[4.44] Aircraft Characteristics Charts*

There are two identically organized Aircraft Characteristics Charts one for each
Player. Within each nationality the planes are grouped into those needing
pilots and those not requiring pilots. Each plane is listed individually.
Certain bear two or more rows of information. With these planes the owning
Player may freely choose which line of characteristics and capabilities he will
assign that plane every time he readies it. The explanation of the various
ratings is discussed in <<34_1>> of the Air Game.

[#4_45]*[4.45] Organization At Arrival Charts (OA)*

A great deal of time (perhaps too much time) was spent in arriving at the most
accurate Order of Battle possible. As with any major campaign, sources differed,
and the designers were forced, for a variety of reasons, to make several
decisions which abstracted some units (especially anti-aircraft units). We feel
that CNA has, by far, the most accurate Order of Battle ever done for the
Campaign for North Africa. However, if you have information to the contrary
about a specific unit, feel free to adjust the game to fit that information. If
you feel like it, we would also like to hear about that information.

There are three identically organized OA Charts, one for Allied units, one for
German units, and one for Italian units. Each chart is subdivided into sections
hereafter termed sheets. Each sheet contains game and historical information
on a major unit or grouping of units (e.g., all unassigned artillery units;
50th Infantry Division) of that Player's forces. The sheet is laid out as
follows: the name of the major unit or regrouping is at the top.  Below that is
the Basic Morale Rating for all of the counters comprising that unit (untrained
Commonwealth unit's morale at instant of arrival is indicated in parentheses
where needed). This is followed by a list of the counters comprising the unit
and any notes at the bottom of the sheet. The counters comprising the unit are
arranged with the headquarters unit (if any) for that group at the top. Any
units assigned directly to that HQ are indented, and any unit assigned to a
subsidiary unit is further indented and listed in the rows directly below their
brigade level parent unit. The explanation of the information contained under
the column headings is as follows:

_Unit Name_: The historical name of that unit. Certain abbreviations have been
made for each nationality and they are listed at the end of the Chart.

_Counter Abbreviation_: The type as it appears on the counter.

_ID Code_: One, two, or three letters which summarize the unit's
 characteristics. The unit's ratings for a particular ID Code
are listed on the Unit Characteristics Chart for that nationality.

_TOE and Weapons Systems_: A unit comprised of a
single type of weapons system (i.e., TOE Strength Points with identical
cHaracteristics) bears an N(ormal), U(nderstrength), or. O(verstrength)
indicator. If the unit is normal, it arrives (or begins deployed) at its maximum
possible TOE Strength.  If the unit arrives understrength or overstrength its
TOE Strength at arrival will follow the U or O. If, on arrival, a unit comprises
tank, artillery, or antitank TOE Strength Points, the number and then the type
of the different TOE Strength Points will be listed.'

_Arrives_: The Operation Stage/Game-Turn on which the unit arrives. If the unit
beings the first scenario already deployed on the map, it is noted as a D. This
column is a check on the Reinforcement Schedule.

The OA Sheets are needed for a purpose other than pure numerical information.
The OA Sheets list the units originally assigned to a Parent unit.  This is
important, as units assigned to a Parent unit may stack and unstack, attach and
detach themselves quite freely compared to other units being attached to that
same Parent unit. The OA Sheets also, on occasion, list units that were
historically attached to a Parent Formation at certain times during the
Campaign.

There are numerous units that are not assigned to a division. These may be
brigades (the Commonwealth Player has many of these) or simply solitary
battalions, artillery regiments, etc. These units are grouped on OA Sheets
according to their most important assignment characteristics (i.e., all of the
British unassigned anti-air units are on a single OA Sheet).

The designers of CNA have chosen the division/brigade/battalion terminology
system because it was (1) the basic system of a majority of the units in the
campaign, and (2) the system with which they were most familiar. In many places
it does not reflect the actual organizational levels of a unit. This is further
exacerbated by the maddening British desire to call everything a regiment or a
brigade when, in fact, it is a battalion. Thus, the 7th Rifle Brigade is, in
game terms, a battalion (actually the 7th Battalion, the Rifle Brigade) and most
of the "Tank Regiments" are battalion-size units. Most Players familiar with the
campaign should have little trouble with items such as these (few people will
think that the 1st King's Royal Rifle Corps is, in fact, an actual Corps).

[#4_46]*[4.46] Unit Characteristics Charts*

There are three identically organized Unit Characteristics charts, one for
Allied units, one for German units and one for Italian units. The Unit
Characteristics Chart lists each ID Code's maximum TOE Strength Points and its
values for the various Ratings. Unless otherwise indicated on the chart, all
tank, artillery, anti-tank, and certain HQ units may comprise any combination of
the variety of the weapons systems listed. These units take on the
characteristics of the assigned TOE Strength Points (weapons systems). A unit
comprising multiple weapons systems is a single unit for all purposes.
However, all actions are undertaken using the ratings of the individual TOE
Strength Points (e.g., an artillery unit comprising two TOE Strength Points of
eighteen pounder guns and four TOE Strength Points of twenty-five pounder guns
engaging in Barrage will fire at two times the eighteen pounder gun Barrage
Rating plus four times the twenty-five pounder gun Barrage Rating). Note that a
unit comprising different TOE Strength Points normally possess a CPA of that of
the slowest TOE Strength Point. The characteristics of the individiual weapons
systems are listed on the appropriate nationality's Tank and Gun
Characteristics' Chart. Certain unit posses parenthesized combat ratings. These
units are discussed in <<3_3>>. Certain headquarters units' maximum limit in
assigned TOE Strength Points are enclosed in parentheses. Any weapons system TOE
Strength Points assigned to such a unit operate with parenthesized combat
values.  Players should note that the maximum number of assigned TOE Strength
Points for British Tank Regiments (battalion-equivalents) changes slightly in
early 1942, with the influx of the first American tanks. Tank regiments with
only American tanks (Grants and/or Shermans and/or Stuarts) now have a maximum
of 9 TOE Strength Points, not ten. The reason for this decision is not clear;
the allotment of tanks to a regiment, however, was dropped from 52 to 44 when
the tanks were American. This was readjusted later on.


[#4_47]*[4.47] Commonwealth Tank and Gun Characteristics Chart*

This chart lists the values for TOE Strength Points
of a specific type of tank or gun. The definitions of
these characteristics are listed in <<3_3>>.

=== LOG SHEETS

Because of the enormous amount of information provided with CNA, and because of
the game system devised for its use, there are a great number of Play-aids, in
the form of Informational Sheets.  The playing counters themselves have little
combat information other than the unit designations and Stacking Points, and
there are few "tracks" by which the Players can keep visual record of various
supply levels. The reasons for this are many: the desire of the designer to
include as much information as possible; the problem of keeping vital
information secret from other Players; the fact that the game-map itself is so
large that having a plethora of charts and tracks would make it necessary to
rent The Hearst Estate at San Simeon to play it, etc. Therefore, players will
keep track of virtually all the information they need which is quite extensive
on the various sheets. The following sections describe these sheets,
although we hope that they have been so designed that their utilization becomes
self-evident. Players should feel free to devise any other sheets or methods
they feel necessary to ease the flow of the game; most of the sheets in CNA were
"designed" by the playtesters.

One copy of each type of Log Sheet is provided with CNA. Players should
therefore produce as many copies of each form as they need, The designers
suggest you use pencils and write lightly to make complete erasures easy.

[#4_51]*[4.51]* The Log Sheets have been divided into four groups on the basis
of their "owning" Player's usage. This is simply a presentation decision and
has no effect on who actually uses what in a game.

[#4_52]*[4.52] Field Commander's Group*

These forms are used by the Players in charge of frontline fighting combat
units.

_Field Commander Control Sheet_: This is designed to help the Field Commander
coordinate his forces. Each row on the sheet is meant for each counter on the
game-map under the Player's control. These counters will normally be
Division-Eq, and a few Brigade-Eq's. Space is provided for keeping track of the
unit's Capability Point expenditure(s) in that Operations Stage, its Capability
Point Allowance (CPA), current Cohesion Level, Actual Points the unit could
contribute to a Barrage and Offensive and Defensive Close Assault, and its
reserves of Ammo and Fuel. There is space for your "weekly" Stores requirements
for the units as a whole (Players rarely transport Stores on Attached Trucks,
because the Stores are required only once per game-week). The bottom section of
the sheet is for notes, normally detailing peculiarities of certain of the units
attached to the counters listed above them on the sheet.

_TOE Log Sheets_: There are three of these in order to ease handling five basic
division formation and organization structures and counters representing
Brigade-Eq and smaller units. The TOE Log Sheets are the equivalent, for play
purposes, of a giant combat unit counter. Each Parent Unit possesses its own TOE
Log Sheet, and on it the Players keep track of the various strengths and ratings
of the units within that formation, the changes to them and the supplies and
trucks carried by and attached to that unit. The sheets can all be divided into
the following sections or information areas:

_A: Counter Identity_: This is the area on the top of the sheet. The counter's
historical name, its Basic Morale, its Current Morale (if Commonwealth), and
any other useful information (such as its assigned Parent Unit, if any, Garrison
location, engineering capability, etc.) should be written in this section.

_E: Logistics_: This is the area marked "1st Line Transport." The area is
subdivided into Trucks Available and Supplies. The first grouping consists of
two paired rows of three boxes. They are for indicating the total attached
Trucks and of those trucks, which are currently transporting nothing, by
division into Heavy, Medium and Light trucks. The second grouping is for
supplies and troops and/or guns being motorized by the attached trucks by the
amount and the number of trucks and the type that are carrying them.

_F: Combat Information_: Boxes for recording (usually the maximum) number of
actual Points that the unit is capable of in each of the categories.

_D: Augmentation_: This is for recording the attachment of units over that
formation's organization structure. (See Section on <<19_0,Unit Organization>>). The method of
filling out the boxes in this section is identical to that of Maneuver and
Division Assets below. Any unit going i this section is attached to the counter
the Log Sheet represents, although it may be assigned to some other unit.

_G. Notes_: Anything appropriate, ranging from which units are out of ammo or
supplies to the amount of Water required by the elements comprising the counter
every Operations Stage.

_C Divisional Assets/Support Units_: Applies to those units attached directly to
the division and not under a Brigade-Eq HQ (unless ina Common wealth Armored
Division). The boxes are filled in the same manner as Maneuver section.

_B. Maneuver Elements_: These boxes are the heart of the Log Sheet. They are
where the information for the main combat forces comprising the counter is
recorded. Basically, each box is used to record a single counter (i.e.,
attached unit). The information to be recorded consists of the unit's type,
CPA, Fuel and Breakdown Rates (if any), current TOE Strength, name, and its
ratings for barrage, anti-armor, vulnerability, armorprotection, offensive
close assault, defensive close assault and anti-aircraft. Information
concerning whether the unit is simply attached to the unit without being
assigned, and/or is assigned to another parent unit or is a garrison unit,
etc., is best recorded in the notes section. A tank or gun unit that is
comprised of more than one weapons system (i.e., type of TOE Strength Point)
will require more than one box to represent the unit (as many boxes as there
are weapons systems). A unit assigned but not at present attached to the unit
whose Log Sheet you are handling still occupies space within the formation's
organization. This space may not be filled by attaching other units in its
place. For ease of play, fill in "detached" in the box of sucha unit.

The recorded information may be written in or adjacent to the unit's box in any
manner the Player desires as long as he and the other Player's have no problems
in reading it.

_Brigade TOE Log Sheet_: This is used for counters representing Brigade-Eq and
smaller units. The formation's organization limits can be found by using the
Formation Organization Chart and the Formation Attachment Chart. It is useful
to put these limits in the Notes Section. As this is a multipurpose form, the
boxes in the Maneuver Elements and Augmentation sections are unadorned and can
be divided in any manner necessary.

_Infantry Division TOE Log Sheet_: The boxes in the Maneuver Elements section are
organized in a very restricted fashion. Some of the boxes in the Divisional
Assets and all of the boxes in the Augmentation sections are unadorned to
permit recording of multiple weapons systems occurring in the same unit. The
division's organization and augmentation limits can be determined from the
charts indicated above.

Allied and Italian Armored and German Division TOE Log Sheets This is free form
with the boxes unstructured so as to permit the expected variations in both
multiple weapons systems in a single unit and variations in division
organization.

[#4_53]*[4.53] Rear Area Commander's Group*

This group belongs to the Player in charge of construction, demolition, mopping
up operations, and other rear area jobs having nothing to do with supplies.
(The Player will usually have a Trucks and Major End Items Control Sheet as he
will normally be assigned some trucks in order to handle routine operations
without bothering the Logistics Commander).

_Vehicle Repair Control Sheet_: Permits the Player to handle all broken down
vehicle, destroyed tanks and abandoned vehicle counters.

_Naval Convoy Log Sheet_: While designed primarily for Axis strategic Naval
convoys it is also used for either Player's tactical shipping. The sheet permits keeping track of naval transport, its location, destination, transit, what is being transported, etc.

_POW Control Sheet_: Designed to handle all POW's, their Capability Points
expended, location and inhabitation of the POW Camps, and the TOE Strength and
infantry-type of their Guards.

[#4_54]*[4.54] Air Marshal's Group*

The Player in charge of all the airplanes uses the following two forms and
usually the Supply Dump Control Sheet to simplify required aircraft supply
expenditures the aircraft require.

_Squadron Ground Support Unit Sheet_: The sheet contains space for controlling
six squadrons of planes, the maximum number that can be berthed at an airfield.
Each squadron section permits counter location, basic composition, aircraft
characteristics recording, and the state and Mission of each plane in the
squadron.

_Air Mission Log Sheet_: Permits the Player to coordinate all air missions
assigned in that Operations Stage/Game-Turn, by hex and by squadron supplying
the planes.

[#4_55]*[4.55] Logistics Commander's Group*

The Player in overall charge of supplies.

_Trucks and Major End Items Control Sheet_: Used for the Player's Truck Convoys.
Organized to identify, within each counter, the number of each type of truck in
the convoy, what supplies are being transported and by what trucks; which
trucks are ‘empty', any replacement points, repaired vehicles, returning
Guards, etc., being returned or exchanged between units.

_Supply Dumps Control Sheet_: Enables the Player to keep track of the supplies
and location of each of his supply dumps. It is strongly suggested that the
Logistics Commander determine which of his dumps will be actively or constantly
used and those which are not and separate them into different sheets, as the
actual supply dump counter ID number has no effect.

_General Supply Net Sheet_: The .Logistics Commander's chief headaches are how
much supply does he have, how much is coming in, and how much of that supply is
likely to be used in the near future. This sheet is set up to help prevent him
from running out of a supply by accident, as it were, either locally or
strategically.

_Supply Requisition Form_: The Logistics Commander is in charge of disbursing
these to the various Field Commanders and Air Marshals. This may seem humorous
at this point, but the form proved quite helpful in maintaining good supply
organization, and it sure beats yelling at the top of your voice for 100
gallons of fuel.

[note]
====
The process used to manufacture
counters sometimes results in images being slightly off-center or in colors
spilling along the edges of differently colored counters. Counters displaying
such minor imperfections cannot be replaced by SPI. Only in cases where the
counters are not legible can SPI supply replacement parts.
====

In the Land Game, the Players deal with the fine distinctions of terrain and
local and variable weather encountered by the actual combatants. The
interlocking and detailed movement and combat systems permit the Players to
recreate real time and space "continuous" movement and combat. The
organization and equipment rules create voluminous options, allowing the
Players to deploy and maneuver company level and larger forces with equal ease
while at the same time differentiating between raw, poorly motivated, or badly
armed units and veteran, well motivated, well equipped forces as well as
changes in the same unit from one state to the other.

[#5_0]
== THE SEQUENCE OF PLAY (Land Game)

[#5_1]
=== THE GAME-TURN

In CNA each Game-Turn covers a period of approximately one week. However, to
better handle combat operations, each Game-Turn is divided into three
Operations Stages. Each Operation Stage is the equivalent of 2-3 days of
activities and, within each such Stage, each Player performs a sequence of
events covering all aspects of the game. Thus the Players complete their
operations within one Operations Stage, proceed to the second, and then the
third, thus finishing one full Game-Turn. Certain operations are performed only
at the beginning of the actual Game-Turn. Most of the game operations —
movement and land combat — are performed within the Operations Stage. The basic
unit of time within the game is thus the Operations Stage.

[#5_2]
=== LAND GAME GAME-TURN SEQUENCE OUTLINE

This Sequence of Play applies when playing the Land Game without the Air and
Logistics Games.

[upperroman]
==== I. INITIATIVE DETERMINATION STAGE

The Players determine who will have the Initiative for the coming Game-Turn
(Section <<7_0>>). The Player going first within an Operations Stage (below) is
known as Player "A"; the other as Player "B.”'

[upperroman]
==== II. NAVAL CONVOY STAGE 

[upperletter]
===== A. Naval Convoy Schedule Phase

The Axis Player plans what specific cargoes the ships will carry and their
routes. See <<32_0>> or Section <<56_0>>. The Axis Player plans for the arrival
of future Replacements from the Axis Replacement Points Pool. Likewise, the
Commonwealth Player consults the Commonwealth Production Table and determines
how many Replacement Points he will receive two turns henc and plans for their
arrival. .

===== B. Tactical Shipping Phase

Both Players plan the transport of cargo between African ports. Note: The Axis
Coastal Ships are represented in the game by counters. Allied coastal shipping
is not represented by counters and is limited only by the port capacities.

==== III. FIRST OPERATIONS STAGE 

===== A. Initiative Declaration Phase

The Player who gained the Initiative in Stage I now states whether he will be
Player "A" or Player "B" for this particular Operations Stage.

===== B. Weather Determination Phase 
The Player with Initiative rolls for Weather (<<29_0>>). 

===== C. Organization Phase

The following segments are undertaken in any order desired.

. _Reorganization Segment_: Attachment and/or assignment of Reinforcements, Replacements or any other non-assigned units including Trucks may be undertaken. Detachment of units may also be accomplished.

. _Construction Segment_: 
.. Construction Completion Step: Any work scheduled
for completion is finished, removing and adding any markers necessary. Units
that have finished construction are free to move. 

.. Construction Initiation/Continuation Step: any units beginning or continuing work on
projects are noted. They may not voluntarily move in the remainder of the
Operations Stage (Exception: Reaction).

. _Training Segment_: 

.. Training Completion Step: Units and Replacement Points
completing a level of Training are noted and the effects in Morale applied. 
.. Any units beginning or continuing Training are noted. They may not move
voluntarily in the remainder of the Operations Stage (Exception: Reaction). .

===== D. Naval Convoy Arrival Phase

All Reinforcements, Replacement Points and Ammo Points scheduled for Arrival
(and actually arriving) appear in their designated Ports of Arrival or Entrance
hexes.

===== E. Commonwealth Fleet Phase

. Fleet Assignment Segment: The Commonwealth Player assigns his ships to any
sea or coastal hexes.

. Fleet Repair Segment: Any Repair work on ships is undertaken at this time.

===== F. Reserve Designation Phase

Player "A" designates which of his units he is placing in Reserve Status,
indicating such with a Reserve I marker (see <<18_0>>).

===== G. The Movement and Combat Phase

The following four Segments comprise the Movement and Combat Phase. Player "A"
may if he so wishes, repeat Segments 1 through 4 as many times as he desires
within the restrictions of the Continual Movement Rules (<<8_2>>). Each repetition
must include all four segments. 

1. _Movement Segment_: All units, except
unattached Trucks and Tank Recovery Squadrons, not in Reserve and capable of
being moved may be moved. Non-Phasing (Player "B") units may React if
permitted and Player "B" wishes to do so. 

2. _Breakdown Determination Segment_:
All vehicles and motorized units of both sides check for Breakdown (<<2_10>>).
Broken down vehicles are indicated by a marker. 

3. Combat Segment: (Combat isresolved as follows see <<11_0>> through <<15_0>>).

.. Position Determination Step: Both Players determine the "position" of all Gun-and Armor-class units.

.. Barrage Step: Both Players secretly plot and then execute any Barrages. 

.. Retreat Before Assault Step: Player "B”' may Retreat Before Assault any of his
units permitted to doso. 

.. Force Assignment Step: Both Players secretly
assign TOE Strength Points to Anti-Armor or Close Assault. Player "A"
determines which Assaults will be Probes (although he need not reveal this
decision) and which TOE Strength Points will be withheld from Assault. 

.. Anti-Armor Step: Both Players simultaneously resolve any Anti-Armor Fire,
removing all casualties. Placement of Destroyed Tanks markers are made if
necessary. 

.. Close Assault Step: Close Assaults are resolved in any order that
Player "A" desires. He announces which Assaults are actually Probes after each
is resolved.

4. Reserve Release Segment: Player "A" may release any of his Reserves that he wishes.

===== H. Truck Convoy Movement Phase

Player "A" may move his Second and Third Line Trucks (unattached) and any
POW's and Guards.

===== J. Commonwealth Rail Movement Phase

If Player "A" is the Commonwealth Player he may utilize Rail Movement (<<8_7>>) for units and/or Supplies.

===== K. Repair Phase

1. _Towing Segment_: Player "A”' may tow Broken down and Recovered vehicles.

2. _Maintenance Segment_: Player "A" may attempt to Repair Broken down or
destroyed vehicles which were not towed in this Phase.

===== L. Patrol Phase

If the Phasing Player has not engaged in Assault, he may use Patrols for
reconnaissance purposes.

*At this point Player "B" undertakes Phases F through L, replacing any
references to "A” with “B" and "B" with "A"*

==== IV. SECOND OPERATIONS STAGE

Both Players repeat all facets of the First Operations Stage.

==== V. THIRD OPERATIONS STAGE

Both Players repeat ail facets of the First Operations Stage.

==== VI. END OF GAME-TURN

You have now completed one Game-Turn, a full week of the real campaign. Take a
breather, havea beer and a sandwich, contact your loved ones to let them know
you're still alive, and return for another Game-Turn.

[#6_0]
== THE CAPABILITY POINT SYSTEM

GENERAL RULE:

CNA uses a Capability Point system to control all aspects of a given land
unit's abilities. A unit's Capability Point Allowance (CPA) is a numerical
representation of a unit's ability to undertake any and all functions: movement
(including retreats and advances), combat, loading, transporting, construction,
etc. There is not a function in the game that will not cost a unit some of its
CPA (with some minor exceptions). CPA thus regulates each and every aspect of
play. Under certain circumstances units may exceed their CPA. To do so will
affect a unit's Cohesion, earning it Disorganization Points (which may affect
Morale). Yet, the ability to exceed its CPA allows a unit to stretch itself to
the limit, to perform feats it might not ordinarily perform — at a price. Players should thus keep close track of each unit's CP's expended and its Cohesion Level on the Sheets provided.

[#6_1] 
=== HOW THE CPA SYSTEM WORKS

[#6_11]*[6.11]* Each unit has a Capability Point Allowance (CPA). The CPA for
each unit is given on the OA Sheets. Certain Gun units have a CPA of "0” these
units are considered to have a CPA of 10 for all purposes other than movement.

[#6_12]*[6.12]* Every function that a unit would need to perform costs that
unit some portion of its CPA. The costs of each such function are listed on the
Capability Point Cost Table, Section <<6_3>>. Except where noted, everything a unit
does costs CP's.

[#6_13]*[6.13]* The CPA for a given unit refers to the number of Capability
Poins that unit may use in a given Operations Stage without earning
Disorganization Points (See <<6_2>>). Thus, a Tank Battalion with a CPA of '25'
could use 25 CP's in an Operations Stage without garnering any Disorganization
Points.

[#6_14]*[6.14]* The allotment of CP's for an Operations Stage refers to both
Players' portions of that Operations Stage. Thus, if the Axis Player goes
"last" in a given Operations Stage any CP's used by his units in Retreating,
Reacting, etc., during the Commonwealth portion of that Operations Stage are
counted against those units' CPA's for that Operations Stage. As the Operations
Stage progresses, Players should keep track of CP's expended by units on either
the TOE Sheet for that unit or on the Field Commander Control Sheet. 

*Example*: At the beginning of the first Operations Stage of the September III, 1940
Game-Turn (Game-Turn 1), the First Royal Northumberland Fusiliers (a
non-motorized, Machinegun battalion at this point) has a CPA of _eight_. To start
the game, the Italians move and attack the 1st RNF. They have no artillery and
do not barrage. The Allied Player decides to Retreat Before Assault three hexes
at a cost of six CP's. The 1st RNF did not use any CP's to defend, and the
Italians did not expend any CP's to Close Assault, as the Allied unit retreated
before any could be expended. Thus when the Commonwealth Player begins his
portion of that Operations Stage the Ist RNF battalion will have only two CP's
remaining before it exceeds its CPA and earns Disorganization Points.

[#6_15]*[6.15]* The CPA of a "Parent Formation”' (e.g., division, brigade,
etc.) is that of the /owest CPA of the units comprising that parent formation,
regardless of the CPA of any higher-CPA units. If the British 7th Armored
Division was to move as an entity (consult the OA Sheet for the 7th Arm. Div)
it would move with a CPA of ‘10', or that of its lowest-CPA unit — the Ist KRRC
(without trucks).

[#6_16]*[6.16]* A unit does not have to use all of its CP's in a single
Operations Stage. However, CP's not used in one Operations Stage do not carry
over into the next Operations Stage (unlike Cohesion Levels, which do). They
are not transferrable from one unit to another (although an infantry unit may
assume the CPA ofa truck if it is motorized; see <<6_17>>).

[#6_17]*[6.17]* Certain units may become "motorized" during the game: i.e.,
Infantry units (those units witha basic CPA of 10 or less) may use Truck units
to transport them. Infantry units being thus transported by Truck units assume
the CPA of the Truck unit carrying them. Thus, if the Ist RNF were to be
motorized by Medium Trucks it would now have a CPA of ‘20', instead of ‘8'.
(See also Section <<8_9>>). Anti-air units with listed CPAs of 0+ may be motorized by assigning one Medium or one Heavy Truck Point per TOE
Strength Point of Artillery.

[#6_2] 
=== COHESION

Cohesion represents a unit's state of exhaustion and disintegration
(Disorganization) or elation (Reorganization). A unit with a Cohesion Level of
'0' is its normal self. A unit in Disorganization, with a minus Cohesion
Level, has probably been exerting itself beyond the normal call of duty, while
a unit with a plus Cohesion Level (Reorganization) has been winning battles.
The Cohesion Level of a unit affects its Morale Level at the instant of combat,
which in turn will affect its performance in that battle. (See Section <<17_0>>).

[#6_21]*[6.21]* Whenever a unit exceeds its CPA within a given Operations Stage
it earns Disorganization Points (DP's). For each Capability Point that a unit
uses over its CPA it earns one Disorganization Point. Thus, a unit witha CPA of
‘15° that uses 18 CP's in an Operations Stage earns three DP's. [A unit may
also earn DP's as a result of combat.] If a unit (Parent Formation as well as
all units in that formation) suffers losses of 30% or greater in any one Close
Assault it earns three DP's. (See also <<15_29b>>).

[#6_22]*[6.22]* DP's are used to decrease the Cohesion Level of a unit. Thus a
unit with a Cohesion Level of -1 that earns three DP's now has a Cohesion Level
of -4. DP's accumulate from Segment to Segment; they may be negated only by
certain actions on the part of the unit (See <<6_23>>). Furthermore, DP's are
credited immediately — not at the end of an Operations Stage. 

*Example*: the Ist
RNF, with a CPA of ‘8' and a Cohesion Level of -2 has expended five CP's in a
Movement Segment. It then assaults an Italian unit, expending the five CP's
necessary to do so. The Ist RNF has thus exceeded its CPA by two, earning 2
DP's and reducing its Cohesion Level by that two to -4. The decrease in the
Cohesion Level takes place before the Close Assault is resolved and the 1st RNF
uses its new Cohesion Level of -4 in computing any changes to Morale.

[#6_23]*[6.23]* A unit's Cohesion Level may be increased by earning
Reorganization Points (RP's). Under no circumstances, however, may a units
Cohesion Level ever go higher than plus ten (+10). RP's earned are added to a
unit's Cohesion Level in such a way as to make it "better". Thus a unit with a
Cohesion Level of -3 that earns five RP's has a new Cohesion Level of +2.
RP's, like DP's, are applied immediately.

[#6_24]*[6.24]* RP's are earned under the following circumstances:

1. For each Operations Stage in which a unit uses absolutely no CP's (except
for a unit undergoing Training or conducting Training; see <<18_3>>) that unit
earns five RP's. However, no unit may ever increase his Cohesion Level above
‘0' by this method. Thus, a unit with a Cohesion Level of -1 that uses no CP's
for an entire Stage would have a Cohesion Level of ‘0' at the end of that Stage
(not +4).

2. For each Close Assault in which a unit participates where the defending upit
vacates its hex completely as a direct result of that Close Assault (not
Reaction or Retreat Before Assault) that unit (victorious) earns fhree RP's.

[#6_25]*[6.25]* A unit with a positive Cohesion Level (e.g., +3) may have its
Basic Morale increased in a given Close Assault, while a unit with a negative
Cohesion Level (e.g., -12) may have its Morale lowered for a given combat (see
<<17_2>>).

[#6_26]*[6.26]* A unit with a Cohesion Level of -26 (or worse) may not move,
attack, or defend. If an enemy combat unit moves adjacent to it it Sur renders,
regardless of the size of the enemy unit. Such "disorganized" units may,
however, refuel, and they do consume Stores and Water. (Note, that a unit may
get a level of worse than -26 if it performs a sing/e action, such as an
attack that would jump it past the -26 level.)

[#6_27]*[6.27]* If a Player has more than one unit (or individual combat
counter) in a given Close Assault, and those individual units have different
Cohesion Levels, then the Cohesion Level of the largest (in terms of type:
division, brigade, etc.) unit prevails. (Use the Stacking Points to determine
the "Jargest" unit.) When determining any adjustments to Morale through
Cohesion Level, if there is more than one "largest unit", then the Cohesion
Levels of all "largest units" are added together and divided by the number of
contributing counters.

Example: Three brigades are assaulting an enemy unit. The Cohesion Level of the
Brigades is -4, -1 and +3, respectively. The Player adds the three together
(-4 + (-)1 + 3 = -2, and then divides by three (-2 + 3 = -1, rounding to the
nearest whole number). The Cohesion Level for that battle is thus -1.

[#6_28]*[6.28]* If a Parent Formation has many units within it that have
different Cohesion Levels the largest unit within the Parent Formation
prevails, as per Case <<6_27>>.

*Example*: An extreme example, and one not likely to occur, is one where a
Parent Formation has three Brigades, all with different Cohesion Levels; in
addition, one of the Brigades contains three battalions, each with a different
Cohesion Level. The Cohesion Level for the latter Brigade would have to be
determined before averaging the three Brigades to get the final Cohesion Level.
Again, this will rarely, if ever, occur. 

[#6_29]*[6.29]* Notwithstanding anything said in <<6_27>> or <<6_28>>, each
unit's Cohesion Level is kept track of individually. As most units ina Parent
Formation will have the same level at all times, this will not prove to be too
big a problem. 

[#6_3] 
=== CAPABILITY POINT COST SUMMARY

(see Charts and Tables)

[#7_0] 
== INITIATIVE 

GENERAL RULE:

Initiative is an abstract, numerical rating represen tative of the strategic
leadership capabilities of a given army. It is used, in the game, to determine
who has the choice to act first within a given Operations Stage. The fact that a
Player has the ability to choose when he will move is a great advantage, and the
army with better initiative will often find that it has the upper hand
operationally — if not materially.

[#7_1] 
=== THE MECHANICS OF INITIATIVE

[#7_11]*[7.11]* The Player who has "Initiative" for a Game-Turn may choose
whether he wishes to move first or last in a given Operations Stage.

[#7_12]*[7.12]* The Player who will have the Initiative is determined at the
beginning of each Game-Turn (not Operation Stage). The Player who gains the
Initiative keepts that Initiative for all three Operations Stages in that
Game-Turn. Thus, the Player with Initiative may choose to move first in the
first Operations Stage, last in the second stage and then first in the third
Stage (which would give him, in effect, two "turns" ina row).

[#7_13]*[7.13]* Each side possesses an Initiative Rating (<<7_2>>), which is
dependent on the date of the GameTurn.

[#7_14]*[7.14]* To determine which Player has the Initiative for a given
Game-Turn, each Player, in the Initiative Determinate Stage, rolls one die and
adds his Initiative Rating to the result of the thrown die. The Player with the
highest total (ties roll again) gains the Initiative. Thus, in October of 1940,
if the Italian Player, with an Initiative Rating of '1', were to roll a '4',
and the Commonwealth Player, with an Initiative Rating of '3', were to roll a
'1', the Italian Player would gain the Initiative by virtue of having a total
of five (1 + 4 = 5) to the Commonwealth total of '4' (3 + 1 = 4). The Italian
Player would now be able to choose, in his Initiative Declaration Phase,
whether he wants to move first or last in the Operations Stage for each of
three Operations Stages in the Game-Turn.

[#7_15]*[7.15]* The Player with Initiative for the first Game-Turn of a given scenario
is usually predetermined, Check the individual scenarios for who has the
Initiative for the first Game-Turn.

[#7_16]*[7.16]* For purposes of the Sequence of Play, the Player who moves
first in an Operations Stage is called "Player A"; the Player who moves last
in an Operations Stage is called "Player B".

[#7_2] 
=== INITIATIVE RATINGS CHART

This chart lists the Axis and CW initiative ratings for all units at any given
point in the game. (See Separate Sheets)

[#8_0] 
== LAND MOVEMENT

GENERAL RULE:

In CNA, Land Movementis a function of the CPA of a unit. Most Movement occurs
during the Movement Segment of the Movement/Combat Phase. During the Movement
Segment, the Phasing Player (i.e., the Player who is in the process of moving)
may move as many or as few of his units as he wishes. They may be moved in any
direction or combination of directions, limited only by their CPA's, enemy
Zones of Control, Terrain restrictions and, in the case of motorized units,
Fuel consumption and Breakdown. Under certain conditions (Reaction and Retreat
Before Assault) the non-Phasing Player may move his units.

PROCEDURE:

Units are moved one at a time, or in stacks, tracing a path of contiguous hexes
through the hex grid. As a unit enters each hex it must expend a portion of its
CPA for entering that hex or crossing a particular hexside. All terrain costs
are listed on the Terrain Effects Chart (8.37). In addition to Movement costs,
Players must pay attention to Breakdown costs for vehicles moving through
certain hexes (see Section <<21_0>>).

[#8_1]
=== HOW TO MOVE UNITS

[#8_11]*[8.11]* Units may be moved voluntarily only during the Movement
Segments or Retreat Before Assault Step. Voluntary movement may never take
place out of the Sequence of Play. Players should note that while Player A may
be the Phasing Player, Player B has several opportunities to move his units
during A's Segment. All movement, of any type, expends CP's. Furthermore, if
the unit moving is a vehicle (armored units, selfpropelled artillery and
trucks), the Player must check for possible Breakdown (see Section <<21_0>>). Units
may move freely through Friendly units, with the exception of movement along
roads and tracks (see <<8_34>>).

[#8_12]*[8.12]* Under certain conditions — usually combat — a unit may be forced
to Retreat. This is considered involuntary movement, in that the retreating
Player does not move by his own choice but rather as a direct result of combat.
However, involuntary movement also requires expenditure of CP's and checks for
Breakdown.

[#8_13]*[8.13]* A unit may never enter a hex containing an enemy unit (see,
however, Case <<27_4>>). Furthermore, movement from hex to hex must be con secutive;
units may not skip hexes. (There are, of course, different rules for aircraft.)

[#8_14]*[8.14]* If a unit moves into an enemy Zone of Control (10.0) it must
stop immediately. It may move no further in that Movement Segment and will
probably have to attack, in some form, the enemy unit exerting that Zone of
Control.

[#8_15]*[8.15]* A unit that begins a Movement Segment in an enemy Zone of
Control may move out of that hex and continue movement under the following
conditions:

1. It may not move directly into an enemy Zone of Control (however, see 
<<10_24>>); and

2. It must pay a cost of two CP's if the units are in "Contact" (see <<8_62>>);
or

3. It must pay a cost of four CP's if the units are "Engaged" (see <<8_63>>).

[#8_16]*[8.16]* Units may continue to move and fight as long as they wish, with
certain restrictions (see <<8_2>>). They may exceed their CPA in an Operations
Stage; however this will affect their Cohesion Level.

[#8_17]*[8.17]* Non-motorized units — those units with CPA's of fen or less —
may never voluntarily expend CP's greater than 50% of their base CPA during
their portion of the Operations Stage (An '8' could not go higher than '12', a
'10' no higher than '15'). Remember, Reaction and Retreat Before Assault are
not voluntary movement in your own portion of an Operations Stage; they occur
in the other player's portion of the Operations Stage. Furthermore, no unit
with a Cohesion Level of — 26 or worse may move.

[#8_18]*[8.18]* Second and Third Line Trucks (i.e., Truck Convoys; see 
<<8_9>>) have their own Movement Phase: The Truck Convoy Movement Phase. Such
trucks may not move (voluntarily) in the normal movement segments. Only trucks
directly attached to, and part of, a combat unit or HQ may move in the normal
Movement Segments. Trucks become attached and/or detached in the Organization
Segment of the Sequence of Play.

[#8_19]*[8.19]* No Commonwealth Land unit may be moved west of Marble Arch
(A2109) at any time, for any reason. (This solves a great number of playing
problems, and also reflects Commonwealth operations considerations and
strategy.)

[#8_2]
=== THE CONCEPT OF CONTINUAL MOVEMENT

CNA uses a concept called "Continual Movement". Under this concept a given
unit does not possess a set Movement Allowance which it may never exceed, as in
most wargames. Rather a unit has a Capability Point Allowance. If a Phasing
Player wishes to push his units past their CPA he may do so, knowing that it
will affect that unit's Cohesion. In Continual Movement a unit may continue to
move after it has engaged in combat, moving and fighting as long as the Phasing
Player wishes, within certain limits.

Continual Movement generates certain problems in terms of Time-and-Space
Relationships. The rules attempt to account for the fact that time passes while
one unit is moving; that other units are not standing still.

[#8_21]*[8.21]* Units are not limited as to the number of times they may move
and engage in combat during a given Operations Stage except for Cases <<6_26>>,

8.17, and <<8_23>>. Thus, a unit may move adjacent to an Enemy unit, engage it in
combat, move away (or stay), engage the same or another unit in combat, etc.,
as the Phasing Player wishes. The unit simply expends CP's for a//actions it
performs.

[#8_22]*[8.22]* Within a given Movement/Combat Phase there may be several
segments of Movement and Combat. These are, to a certain extent, regimented. In
essence, the Phasing Player moves his units. He then, after all such movement
is completed, resolves any combat. He may then again move any of his units
(within the exceptions mentioned in <<8_21>>); after all movement at that time is
completed any combat necessitated or desired is resolved. This cycle is
repeated until the Phasing Player no longer wishes to move his units or have
combat. Remember, no combat occurs until a@// movement has ceased within each
Sequence of Movement and Combat.

[#8_23]*[8.23]* Only those Phasing units that have finished a Movement Segment
within two hexes of an enemy unit are free to move again. A Phasing unit that
finishes its movement more than two hexes from an enemy combat unit may not
continue to move during that Movement Phase, regardless of the number of CP's
remaining, unless that is a unit that has been placed in Reserve Status (18.0).
Players should note that Reserve Status is an exception to <<8_22>>.

[#8_24]*[8.24]* A Phasing unit that begins any Movement/Combat Phase in the
Zone of Control of an Enemy unit must expend fwo CP's to break "Contact" — or
four CP's, if such position was brought about by an "Engaged" result on the
Assault CRT — if it wishes to move. (Note, that in the case of an Engaged
result, the presence of an enemy ZOC does not matter.)

[#8_25]*[8.25]* A Friendly unit may attack a given Enemy unit more than once in
a given Operations Stage, with neither unit ever moving! However, each combat
occurs after all movement of other units cease. If there is no movement by any
units, combat may still proceed for as long as the Phasing Player wishes,
providing he has the necessary Ammunition and wishes to expend the required
number of CP's.

[#8_3] 
=== TERRAIN EFFECTS ON MOVEMENT

[#8_31]*[8.31]* Units expend a varying number of CP's to enter hexes or cross certain
hexsides, depending upon the type of unit and/or what type of hex or hexside is
involved. The costs range from % CP for roads (for motorized units) to + 8 for
a vehicle to move down an escarpment via a track or an infantry-type unit to
cross The Nile without a "bridge". See the Terrain Effects Chart for all
effects (8.9).

[#8_32]*[8.32]* Certain types of hexes and/or hexsides are prohibited to
certain types of units. E.g., certain vehicles may never enter a Salt Marsh
hex, unless it is onaroad or track.

[#8_33]*[8.33]* Roads and Tracks may be used to facilitate movement through terrain
obstacles and speed movement over the entire game-map. For a unit to gain any
benefit from movement on a Road or Track if must move from one Road/Track hex
directly into an adjacent, connecting Road/Track hex through a Road/Track
hexside. Units which are moving along Roads or Tracks ignore, for movement
purposes, any other terrain in the hex or hexside, with the exception of
vehicles crossing Escarpments (see <<8_42>>).

[#8_34]*[8.34]* A unit comprised (at least in part) of vehicles (i.e., tanks,
trucks, artillery, etc.) that is moving along a Road or Track is limited in its
ability to move through other Friendly units on the Road or Track in that hex;
see <<9_33>>. Such

moving units may always pass around Friendly units that are on a Road or Track
by moving through the terrain in the hex, i.e., bypassing the units on the road
by moving off the road and around them, going back on the road in the next hex.

[#8_35]*[8.35]* Most of the terrain in CNA is selfexplanatory, especially when
the Terrain Effects Chart is consulted. However, at this point it would help to
be able to visualize the difference between slopes, ridges and escarpments. An
idealized sideview of each of the above types of terrain is provided below so
that players can see what is being abstracted:

[note]
====
Here goes a diagram
====

_Slopes and Escarpments_ always have an "up" side and a
"down" side (see the Terrain Key). The splash contours of the respective
terrain symbols are always on the "down" side of the slope or escarpment.
Thus, when a unit is crossing a slope or escarpment hexside it is moving either
up the slope/escarpment or down the slope/escarpment.

_Ridges_ have no "direction"; crossing a Ridge hexside has the same effect
regardless of which direction the unit is coming from. In essence, ridges are
two-sided slopes.

[#8_36]*[8.36]* Certain types of terrain restrict combat or give the attacker
or defender a combat benefit. These benefits are discussed throughout the
sections on Combat, but they are all summarized on the Terrain Effects Chart.

[#8_37]*[8.37] Terrain Effects Chart*

(see Charts and Tables)

[#8_4] 
=== SPECIAL TERRAIN EFFECTS ON MOVEMENT

For those gamers used to Panzerarmee Afrika and Afrika Korps, the game-map of
CNA will come as something of a shock and a revelation: there is terrain in all
those empty spaces. And much of this terrain is unlike that of anywhere else on
earth, bringing with it special problems for both designer and player. The most
important of these are discussed below.

[#8_41]*[8.41]* _Wadis_. Wadis are, in essence, dried-out river beds. There are
several major areas of wadis in North Africa. While the series of wadis that
"guards"  the Libyan Sand Desert, south of Cyrenaica, is the largest group,
perhaps the most important series of wadis are those extending like fingers from
the Jebel Akhdar (game-map B).  Along with the other difficult terrain in the
area, the wadis of the Jebel Akhdar greatly hinder rapid movement.

All units expend CP's to cross a Wadi hexside. (All wadis in CNA have been
placed along hexsides, with the exception of the Wadi Natrun, just west of the
Nile Delta, which is treated, for gamepurposes, as if it were Salt Marsh.) In
addition, there is a Breakdown Factor of eight for vehicles crossing a wadi
hexside. Roads negate wadis for movement purposes, while Tracks halve the cost
to cross. Vehicles crossing a Wadi on a Road use the Road Breakdown Rate (2
BP), while vehicles crossing on Tracks garner four BP's, not eight.

Players should note that in an Operations Stage in which the Weather is
Rainstorm wadis in affected map sections are impassable at ail points, except
where they are traversed by roads. The cost to cross a rain-swollen wadi by Road
is +2 CP's; there is no additional Breakdown cost (i.e., it is still 1/2 BP).

[#8_42]*[8.42]* _Escarpments_. The escarpments, which were such an integral part
of the Desert Campaign, are at the edge of the Libyan Plateau, which rises from
the edge of the strip of land that borders the Mediterranean. In some places
the rise is gradual; in others it is sharp and severe, virtually uncrossable by
vehicles. Movement costs for crossing escarpment hexsides are listed in the
Terrain Effects Chart (<<8_37>>). However, other factors must be noted. No vehicle
may ever move "up" an escarpment (i.e., cross an escarpment hexside by
moving from the down side to the up side). If a Track crosses an escarpment
hexside, vehicles may use the Track to move down the escarpment, but never up.
The cost for moving down via Track would be +8 CP's and six Breakdown Points.

[#8_43]*[8.43]* Slopes and Ridges. These were discussed in <<8_35>>. All units may
cross these hexsides at a variety of Movement and Breakdown costs; see <<8_37>>.

[#8_44]*[8.44]* _Salt Marsh_. Salt marshes are depressions consisting of very
fine and treacherous salty sand —a veritable quicksand grave for vehicles, and
no fun for infantry either. Vehicles, except for Light Trucks, Recce-type
units, and motorcycle infantry may enter or leave a Salt Marsh hex only on a
Road or Track. A prohibited vehicle that enters a Salt Marsh hex without using
the Track, whatever the reason, is Abandoned (see <<5_33>>). Because most vehicles
are prohibited from entering Salt Marshes in a normal manner, no motorized unit
or AFV (tank, armored car, etc.) may ever engage in Assault with units
defending in a Salt Marsh hex. The one camel unit in the game (the Italian
Meharisti Camel Cavalry) travels as infantry in non-track Salt Marsh hexes, as
these hexes could not support /oaded camels.

[#8_45]*[8.45]* _Desert_. Desert hexes, which comprise the area known as the
Libyan Sand Desert, contain soft, shifting sand (as opposed to "Clear" hexes,
which have a clay-like substance more supportive of vehicular traffic.) Desert
hexes are forbidden to Light Trucks, Motorcycle infantry, and motorcycle Recce
units whose weight was not sufficient enough to provide the traction necessary
for moving vehicles through the soft surface. Such units may not enter any
Desert hexes, whether traversed by Tracks or not. See <<8_37>> for all terrain
costs.

[#8_46]*[8.46]* _Tracks_. The major communication network of the North African
Plateau is the series of tracks that criss-cross the entire area. The tracks
are useful not in that they are easier to walk or ride in (in some places they
are no easier than the terrain in the hex); what they do provide is direction
— i.e., which way to go. Sense of direction in the "desert" is almost
non-existent; the tracks provide that. Movement along tracks is at 1 CP per hex
and halves most hexside crossing CP costs. In addition, units using a track pay
only one-half the normal Breakdown cost for that hex.

[#8_47]*[8.47]* _Railroads and Roads_. The use of these two are discussed quite
succinctly in the body of the rules. However, Players should note that, on the
game-map, there are large sections of railroad and some' roads that are not
constructed as of September 1940 and must be constructed to exist. Specific
later scenarios will list the hexes that have been constructed by that time.
Unconstructed railroad hexes are ignored for all purposes. Unconstructed roads
are treated as tracks.

[#8_48]*[8.48]* _Oases_ do not affect movement, But it might be worthwhile to
point out here that Oases are considered to be nondiminishing Supply Dumps for
Water and Stores.

[#8_49]*[8.49]* All of these terrain types also affect combat. However, such
effects are discussed in the various combat Sections, especially <<15_3>>.

[#8_5] 
=== REACTION

Reaction is the capability of a unit to "get out of the way" of an attacking
unit or units before the enemy can launch an attack against the reacting unit.
Reaction is movement conducted by the nonPhasing Player — as defender — in the
opposing Player's Movement/Combat Phase, A unit's ability to react is limited
to certain specific situations. Reaction expends CP's.

[#8_51]*[8.51]* Reaction is the process of movement by a Friendly, non-Phasing
unit in response to an Enemy Combat unit moving adjacent to that Friendly,
non-Phasing combat unit. Reaction follows all the standard rules of movement,
except as stated below.

[#8_52]*[8.52]* A given unit may React as many times as the Player wishes
during an Operations Stage. A unit "reacting" expends CP's; however, it does
not expend CP's for Breaking Contact/Engaged, as defined in <<8_24>>.

[#8_53]*[8.53]* All units may react, with the following exceptions:

a. Non-motorized units, Squadron Ground Support Units, and Truck Convoys not
stacked with Friendly combat units may never React.

b. No unit may React if the Enemy unit moving adjacent to it has a CPA six or
more points greater than that of the non-Phasing unit and the owner of the
Phasing unit announces there will be a Close Assault by his unit against the
non-Phasing unit. Thus, a motorized infantry battalion may react when a tank
battalion with a CPA of 25 moves adjacent to it, because a motorized unit will
have a minimum CPA of 20 (from its trucks). However, if the same motorized
battalion were to be moved adjacent to by an enemy Recce battalion, with a CPA
of 45, the motorized battalion could not React. (It could still Retreat Before
Assault, however; see <<13_0>>). Furthermore, each units is treated
individually; thus, Second Line Light Trucks stacked with (but not attached to)
that motorized battalion could retreat (as they have an extended CPA of 40,
only 5 less than 45). 

c. If a non-phasing unit is already in an enemy Zone of Control (usually as a
result of (b) above) it may not React. In this way, faster units "pin" slower
units.

d. A unit that is in combat or Engaged may not react.

[#8_54]*[8.54]* Notwithstanding anything said in <<8_53>>, no battalion size unit
may ever pin a division and no company-size unit may ever pin a brigade or
larger unit. The terms used here refer to size, and not specifically the unit
type/designation. Size of unit may be determined by Stacking Points as well as
the TOE. Thus a division may be but a skeleton force, as may other units. The
problem should rarely occur, as most units are fairly easy to determine as to
size and type, but if there is a question use your Common Sense (or flip a coin
if that commodity is in short supply). See <<9_2>>.

[#8_55]*[8.55]* Reacting units may never enter an Enemy Zone of Control during
their Reaction Movement. Otherwise, Reaction is undertaken like normal
movement, with no limit as to how far a unit may React/Move.

[#8_56]*[8.56]* A unit may react, within the restrictions listed in <<8_53>> above,
even if it is attached to a parent formation. In this case, the CP is expended
for detachment and the unit may then react. A brigade HQ may not be detached
from a division unless all of the units at present attached to the brigade HQ
are also detached. In addition, the

detachment of units may not be performed such that the parent unit is vow
"pinned" as a result of its becoming a shell and having <<8_54>> now apply.
Attached trucks may be freely divided amongst the parent unit and its detaching
and reacting units. Note that this rule does nor permit a parent unit to detach
low CPA units in order for the parent unit to now be able to react.

[#8_6] 
=== BREAKING OFF

[#8_61]*[8.61]* Breaking Off is a function of Movement that occurs when a unit
beings a Friendly Movement Segment in Contact or Engaged with an Enemy Combat
unit. Contact and Engaged markers are provided to indicate such status. (There
has been some discussion of this in <<8_24>>; see also Case <<15_81>>).

[#8_62]*[8.62]* Units are in Conract if they are inan Enemy Zone of Control at
the beginning of a Movement Segment.

[#8_63]*[8.63]* Units are Engaged directly as a result of Close Assault;
Engaged is a combat result. Engaged units do not necessarily have to be in
Enemy Zones of Control. ,

[#8_64]*[8.64]* A unit in Contact or Engaged with an Enemy combat unit at the
beginning of a Movement Segment or a Retreat Before Assault (not Reaction) may
not move until it has paid a cost in CP's to break off such contact. In
addition, First Line Trucks wishing to detach from an Engaged or Contacted
parent unit must expend the necessary CP's to so detach. Second/Third Line
Trucks wishing to attach as First Line Trucks to Engaged or Contacted units do
not expend additional CP's to so attach,

[#8_65]*[8.65]* A unit in Contact must expend two CP's to Break Off before
moving.

[#8_66]*[8.66]* A unit that is Engaged must expend four CP's to Break Off
before moving.

[#8_67]*[8.67]* When all of the Friendly units that were in Contact or Engaged
with an Enemy combat unit Break Off that Enemy unit is no longer Engaged or in
Contact.

[#8_68]*[8.68]* Contact and Engaged markers affect only the combat units in the
hex at the time of their placement. Units moving into a hex with a Contact or
Engaged marker are not affected by that marker.

[#8_7] 
=== RAIL MOVEMENT OF LAND UNITS

[#8_71]*[8.71]* There are two rail lines in the game. The Alexandria-Mersa
Matruh line is an active railroad. It may be extended by construction (see 
<<24_6>>) and may be used only by the Commonwealth Player, regardless of the
strategic situation. The Soluch-Benghazi-Barce rail line is on the gamemap
solely for historical purposes; it may not be used for anything and has no
effect whatsoever on terrain or movement. (It was used by the Italians in 1940,
but not in any way as to affect the game.)

[#8_72]*[8.72]* The Commonwealth Player may use Rail Movement once per
Operations Stage, in the Commonwealth Rail Movement Phase. He may transport
units and/or supplies, and he may move one "stack" of these any distance along
the rail line in each direction. Thus, a unit may be moved west from Alexandria
to any rail hex along a finished rail line as far as (eventually) Tobruk, and
supplies in Tobruk may be moved east to Matruh.

[#8_73]*[8.73]* To use Rail Movement a unit must start the Operations Stage on a
rail hex, it may not have expended any CP's for any other reason during that
Operations Stage, and it may not be in an Enemy ZOC. The unit is then moved to
the desired point along the line where it stops. It may not enter an Enemy ZOC
or Enemy-occupied hex at any time while using Rail Movement.

[#8_74]*[8.74]* The Commonwealth Player may use the two railroad lines once in
each direction. I.e., he may carry one unit (or stack) as far as he wishes in an
easterly direction and another stack (or perhaps supplies) as far as he wishes
in a westerly direction.

[#8_75]*[8.75]* The maximum number of Stacking Points that may be carried by
Rail Movement is two.  (Thus large Brigades must be broken down for Rail
Movement). For supply maximums, see Section <<49_3>>.

[#8_76]*[8.76]* Rail hexes that have been destroyed by bombing, etc. may not be
entered by Rail Movement until they are repaired. Likewise, the rail hexes not
yet in existence (<<8_47>>) can not be used until they have been constructed (see
<<24_6>>).

[#8_77]*[8.77]* Units may be picked up and dropped off anywhere along a rail
line, as long as the Stacking and directional restrictions are always observed
and no unit using rail has expended CP's in that Operational Stage.

[#8_78]*[8.78]* No Rail hex west of any rail hex occupied by an Axis combat unit
may be used by the Allied Player for Railroad Movement.

[#8_8]
=== TRIPOLI AND TUNISIA

[#8_81]*[8.81]* The area around Tripoli and Tunisia, both important entry ports
for Axis troops and supplies, are represented by a series of four large boxes
and a number of smaller boxes on the western edge of game-map section A. Each
large box represents a specific region, centered around the geographical name in
the box: Tripolitania, Tripoli, Gabes, and Tunis. References to these boxes as a
group are indicated by the term “Tripoli/Tunisia boxes". The smaller boxes are
used to represent the location of units in transit between the Tripoli/Tunisia
boxes.

[#8_82]*[8.82]* Only Axis units and Commonwealth airplanes may enter the
Tripoli/Tunisia region.  No Commonwealth land or sea unit may ever enter any of
the boxes.

{8.83] Air movement to/from the area is performed as per the standard Air Rules,
with the distances listed in the Air Distance Chart. Land movement among the
Tripoli/Tunisia boxes and the boxes and the North Africa proper of the game map
has been abstracted. The distance traveled is measured by the number of
Operation Stages in which a land unit must expend its Capability Point Allowance
in movement. Motorized units are required to consume fuel but are not required
to check for breakdown during movement in, to and from this off-map region. A
unit must expend exactly its Capability Point Allowance in each Operations Stage
of movement in, to, or from the off-map region.

[#8_84]*[8.84]* The number of Operation Stages of movement required by a
specific unit in order to traverse the distance between the various
Tripoli/Tunisia boxes and the map depends upon it Capability Point Allowance.
The movement "rates" for units in the off-map region is listed in the Off-Map
Land Unit Movement Distance Chart (<<8_89>>). A unit being moved from one
Tripoli/Tunisia box (or hex A 2802, see <<8_85>>) to another that can traverse
the distance in a single Operations Stage is simply placed in its new location
and the required fuel is expended. If the unit cannot cover the distance ina
single Operations Stage of movement, it is moved one In Transit box for each
Operations State it is moved until the required number of Operations Stages of
movement have been completed. Note that a unit In Transit is not required to be
moved each Operation Stage and that such a unit may reverse its direction,
returning to its original starting location.

[#8_85]*[8.85]* For a unit to be moved off the game map towards Tripolitania it
must start that Operations Stage in hex A2802. A unit entering the game-map from
the off-map region is simply placed in the Road hex closest to the Tripolitania
box. If there are more than five Stacking Points that are to be brought onto the
map, they may be strung out on the Road in consecutive hexes (road) from the
Tripolitania box; e.g., 5 points in hex 2802, 5.  points in 2803, and 3 points
in 2804.

[#8_86]*[8.86]* Reinforcements and replacements arriving in Tunis or Tripoli may
not be moved from that box during the Operations Stage of their arrival.

[#8_87]*[8.87]* There are no stacking restrictions and unlimited Water in the
Tripoli/Tunisia boxes and the In Transit boxes. In addition, the Tripoli/Tunisia
boxes are considered to contain air facilities, mon-transferrable supplies and
maintenance crews sufficient for every plane the Axis Player has.

[#8_88]*[8.88]* The Tripoli/Tunisia boxes are considered to be Supply Dumps of
unlimited capacity.  However, a truck or motorization point may not be moved in
the Operations Stage in which it loads and/or unloads supplies.

[#8_9]
=== MOTORIZED UNITS/TRUCKS

[#8_91]*[8.91]* A motorized unit in CNA is one that always contains enough
vehicles to transport the entire unit as a single entity. Motorized units
include those comprised of mechanized (i.e., tracked) vehicles, trucks, and
motorcycles. Motorized units are divided into those that are inherently
motorized (whose transportation vehicles may not normally be removed) and those
that are being transported by truck points assigned to that purpose.

[#8_92]*[8.92]* Non-motorized units (i.e., "leg" infantry and a few gun units,
with the exception of the Meharisti Cavalry (camels), may be transformed into
motorized units (and visa versa) by the addition/(subtraction) of sufficient
Truck Points.  When being transported by trucks, a nonmotorized unit's CPA
becomes that of the appropriate rating of the truck that is transporting it.

[#8_93]*[8.93]* Certain non-motorized infantry units are designated as being
historically normally supplied with enough vehicles to motorize the entire unit.
These infantry units are so indicated by a '+' symbol after their CPA on the
Unit Characteristics Chart. These units' characteristics differ only slightly
with respect to their historically nonmotorized brothers (see Cases <<19_9>> and
32.54).

[#8_94]*[8.94]* A motorized unit maintains its CPA even if it is performing an
action which is impossible while actually in a vehicle. Examples: A towed
(inherently) motorized artillery unit Barraging, an infantry unit receiving
defensive benefits from fortifications, a motorized infantry unit assaulting
intoa salt marsh hex.

[8.95] Truck Points may be used to transport
TOE Strength Points or supplies. Truck Points
represented by a counter (for example: all of the
Truck Points attached to an infantry division
which is represented on the game map by its HQ
counter) are assigned transportation duties individually,

Example: An infantry Battalion of six TOE
Strength Points with 10 light, 10 Medium and 10
Heavy Truck Points attached might assign 4 light,
two medium and one heavy Truck Points to the infantry in order to completely motorize the unit
(this is inefficient, but variations on this theme will
inevitably occur). Note that Truck Points are
never required to transport anything, they may
move around empty.

[#8_96]*[8.96] Truck Points may be attached to any unit in

CNA bearing a historical designation. When attached they are represented by the
unit's counter.  However, trucks are automatically under the control of the
highest (largest) ranking Parent Formation to which they are currently attached.
Example: A Truck Point attached to a battalion which is subsequently attached to
a brigade become the property of that brigade. It is not necessary to subdivide
the trucks among the brigade's component units.

[#8_97]*[8.97]* Trucks may be attached to a unit bearing a historical
designation only during the Organization Phase of an Operations Stage (unless
during the Operations State that unit is attached to a Parent Unit). Trucks may
be detached from sucha unit only during the Organization Phase of an Operations
Stage unless that unit is a Parent Unit and detaches any of its attached
subsidiary units during a Movement and Combat Phase. In sucha case any portion
of the total number of attached trucks to that newly detached unit. No unit
witha Cohesion Level of minus five or worse may detach trucks completely from a
unit bearing a historical designation.

[#8_98]*[8.98]* During the owning Player's Player-Turn, trucks that are attached
to units move with those units in the Movement and Combat Phase, and trucks that
are not attached to units are moved in the Truck Convoy Phase. In either case,
trucks may be permitted to move during the opposing Player's Player-Turn
(Reaction, etc.) Trucks that are moved in the Truck Convoy Phase may not exceed
their CPA. If forced to through involuntary movement, they are captured instead.
Truck Points being moved in the Truck Convoy Phase may be moved in any order,
group sub-division, stops and starts. The only restriction being that Truck
Points beginning and ending in the same hex and following the same path of
travel must be moved as a group. Example: Fifty Truck Points begin in C2510.
They are moved as a group (not required) to C2515 at which point 20 are moved to
C2520 where they end their movement for that Truck Convoy Phase. The 30 Truck
Points left in C2515 may now be moved (and sub-divided further if you wish).
Note that this differentiates them from units detached from Parent Units (see
<<19_44>>)

[#8_99]*[8.99]* A Truck marker may represent any of the unattached Truck Points
in that hex at that point in time, unless all of those Truck Points are being
used to transport Infantry Replacement Points.  The marker may be used to
represent any Replacement Points or repaired vehicles in that hex (i.e., may not
place the marker if just Tank Replacement Points in the hex). As many markers
may be placed as there are unattached Truck Points in that hex.

[#9_0]
== STACKING
GENERAL RULE:

Stacking refers to the process of placing more than one unit in a hex. Each unit
is worth a certain number of Stacking Points, generally as printed on the
counter, and each hex, according to the type of terrain it encompasses, has a
maximum number of points that may bein that hex.

[#9_1]
=== THE STACKING POINT SYSTEM

[#9_14]*[9.14]* Each unit (or counter) in the game has a Stacking Point value
printed on the face of the unit. (See Sample Units, <<4_22>>). E.g., the 1/8
Panzer Battalion has 1 Stacking Point.

[#9_12]*[9.12]* HQ units, whether Division, Brigade, or Regiment, have
parenthesized Stacking Point values. This means the Stacking Point value of that
HQ is ‘0' when it has no combat units of any type attached; the printed number
is its Stacking Point value when it represents the division or brigade as a
combat unit. (See Unit Equivalents, <<9_2>>).

[#9_13]*[9.13]* Stacking Points not only represent a given number of men but
also, and more importantly, they represent organizational ability. Thus a full
division has a Stacking Point value of '5', while, at the same time, it may
include units whose total Stacking Point values are much greater than five.  The
divisional HQ supplies the necessary administrative and organizational functions
that enables the division to exist, and fight, in a more cohesive state.

[#9_14]*[9.14]* Each hex, or rather each type of terrain, has a maximum number
of Stacking Points which may be in that hex at the end of any Movement Segment.
These limits are listed in Case <<8_37>>.

[#9_15]*[9.15]* Informational markers and air units of all types do not have any
Stacking Point value.

[#9_16]*[9.16]* There are three specific types of units that, on certain
occasions, ignore Stacking restrictions:

[loweralpha] 

. Garrison units (those units with a "G" above their Stacking Point number)
stack freely in the city/village to which they are assigned as a Garrison. E.g.,
the Italian Heavy Weapons battalion assigned as garrison to Fort Maddalenna
would have '0' Stacking Points in that village but '1' point anywhere else.

. Pure anti-aircraft units (those units with the identification symbol for
AA/Flak) stack freely in Major Cities. In addition, one AA/Flak unit may stack
freely with any air landing strip and three in any airfield.  a '0+' CPA that
are not at present motorized (have trucks attached that are being used to
transport them) have zero Stacking Points.

[#9_2]
=== UNIT EQUIVALENTS

[#9_21]*[9.21]* A Division is considered to represent all units assigned and
attached to (not simply stacked with) the HQ unit for that division. Units
assigned (<<19_1>>) to a division (see the TOE Sheets for the units) may not
necessarily be part of that division at a given time; they may have been
detached for duty elsewhere. Only those units with the Parent unit/HQ at a given
time are considered to be part of that parent unit for Stacking purposes.

[#9_22]*[9.22]* The next lowest level of unit organization in CNA is the Brigade
Equivalent. Now, because of the peculiarities of the individual countries
involved, not all units which are called "brigades”' are brigade equivalents.
The Italians used a Regimental designation as their next lowest organizational
level (see any Italian infantry division).  Such a Regiment is considered to be
a Brigade equivalent for game purposes. Furthermore, the British had a
propensity for using the terms “‘brigade" and "regiment" for a whole host of
lesser-sized units, usually battalions. (E.g., the 7th Rifle Brigade is really a
battalion-sized infantry unit while the 7th Motor Brigade is a Brigade).
Players should be guided through this maze not by the unit designation on the
counter or the unit's name but rather through the printed Stacking Point value.
This number, cross-referenced with Section <<9_4>>, will reveal the
organizatioinal level of the unit (for game purposes).

[#9_23]*[9.23]* The basic combat unit in the game is the infantry and tank
battalion ("battalion equivalent"). As noted, some battalion-sized units (actual
battalion equivalents) may be called "regiments" or some such. Check the
Stacking Point value when in doubt.

[#9_24]*[9.24]* Regardiess of its organizational designation, every artillery
unit in the game, with the exception of certain scattered batteries, has a
Stacking Point value of ‘1". (The rare Artillery HQ unit may have a larger
Stacking Point value).

[#9_25]*[9.25]* There are a number of companies and batteries in the game with a
Stacking Point value of "?", due to the miniscule number of men and combat
impact those units had. Nevertheless, unless directly attached or assigned to a
parent unit, no more than five such companies or batteries may ever be stacked
in any one hex, in addition to whatever else is in that hex. Exception: there is
no limit to the number of such units which may be placed in a Major City hex.
Note: an HQ unit that has no combat units attached to it has a Stacking Point
value of "0".

[#9_26]*[9.26]* A Division is considered a "shell" (see Case <<3_1>>) when 50% or
less of the total number of brigade-equivalents that may be assigned to it are
attached to it. E.g., if a division which may have a maximum of two brigades
assigned currently has only one brigade attached to it (ignore any independent
battalions or whatever), the division is considered a shell. A brigade is
considered to be a shell if less than 2/3rds of the total number of battalions
(combat units) that may be assigned to it are attached to it. Exception: a
brigade to which a maximum of two battalions may be assigned is not considered a
shell if two battalions are attached to it and at least one of them is not
itself a shell. A battalion is considered to be a shell when less than 50% of
its maximum TOE Strength Points are attached to it, unless it is an Artillery
battalion (or regiment or whatever); an artillery unit must be less than 25% of
TOE strength to bea shell.

[#9_27]*[9.27]* If a unit attached to a parent formation isa shell, it does not
count as one of the pre-requisite lower level units necessary to allow the
parent unit to qualify as a full-strength unit. For example, a division to which
a maximum of three brigades may be assigned has three brigades attached to it,
but two of the brigades are shells. The division itself is thus considered to
bea shell.

[#9_28]*[9.28]* A unit that is a shell is reduced one level to the next
lowest-level formation for purposes of Unit Differentiation on Close Assault
(see <<15_5>>) and for any rule where unit size is important.  Thus, a division
shell would be considered a brigade equivalent, a brigade shell a battalion
equivalent, and a battalion shell a company equivalent.

[#9_29]*[9.29]* First line (attached) Trucks do not count in any way towards
unit organizational size or for road space stacking limits. Furthermore, Truck
Convoys (unattached, see Case <<9_3>>) that are ina hex do not count against any
stacking limits, except those concerning road space, for which they do count.

[#9_3]
=== THE EFFECTS OF STACKING

Stacking restrictions limit the number of units that can be in a hex at the end
of a Friendly Movement Segment, as well as at the end of an Operations Stage.
Stacking restrictions also affect the ability of motorized units to move through
Friendly units on a Road or Track. Stacking restrictions also apply during
involuntary retreats. The stacking limits for each type of terrain are listed on
the Terrain Effects Chart (<<8_37>>).

[#9_31]*[9.31]* Units may never cease movement ina hex in violation of stacking
restrictions (<<8_37>>).

[#9_32]*[9.32]* Units may always move through other friendly units, and stacking
restrictions apply only at the instant all units have ceased movement.  However,
see <<9_33>> and <<9_35>>.

[#9_33]*[9.33]* A motorized unit (tank, truck, artillery, motorcycle, etc.)
using a Road or Track to facilitate movement may not exceed the five point Road
or Track Stacking Limit by moving through a Friendly unit or units on that Track
or Road. Ifa unit using a Road or Track would create such a situation it must
“‘move around”' the non-moving units, entering that hex without the Road or
Track benefit. Note: some terrain is prohibited to motorized units and such
units could not move off a road to "go around”? in such terrain. A unit ending
its movement in a hex that it entered along a Road or Track counts against the
Road/Track Stacking limit for any other motorized unit(s) using that Road/Track.
For this rule, Trucks in Convoy are treated separately. See Case <<9_29>>. Note:
Off-road markers are provided with the game.  They may be used to indicate units
moved into a road hex without using the Road Bonus, and therefore are not "on
the road" for purposes of this Case.

[#9_34]*[9.34]* Players are not permitted to "break up” a unit in order to avoid
exceeding the limits of <<9_33>>; i.e, moving through an occupied Road/Track hex
a sub-unit at a time and then recombining the subunits into the original unit.
(Players should note that <<9_33>> and <<9_34>> operate to prohibit certain
units from crossing escarpments by tracks if either side of that escarpment is
occupied by Friendly units that would block passage as per Case <<9_33>>).

[#9_35]*[9.35]* Stacking restrictions do apply during involuntary Retreats
(those retreats mandated by the Close Assault CRT). A unit or stack of units may
not retreat through a hex involuntarily in violation of Stacking Restrictions.
However, in involuntary retreats, a stack of units (or parent formation) may be
split up and retreated into different hexes (not through the same hex, though).
Any portion of a unit forcéd to retreat that cannot so retreat because of
Stacking Restrictions is required to "Stand" and receive additional losses (see
<<15_82>>).

[#9_4]
=== UNIT BASIC STACKING

POINT VALUES

(see separate sheet)

[#10_0]
== ZONES OF CONTROL

GENERAL RULE:

The six hexagons immediately surrounding a hex constitute the Zone of Control
(ZOC) of any unit in that hex. However, only certain types and sizes of units
exert ZOC's. Hexes upon which a unit exerts a ZOC are called controlled hexes,
and these inhibit movement of Enemy units. All units must cease movement upon
entering an Enemycontrolled hex.

[#10_1]*[10.1]*
=== WHICH UNITS EXERT A ZONE OF CONTROL

[#10_11]*[10.11]* All combat units above battalionequivalent (i.e. with more
than one Stacking Point) exert a Zone of Control. In addition, if there is more
than one Stacking Point in a hex even if no larger-than-battalion unit is
present, the units in that hex also exert a ZOC. Truck Convoys never exert a
ZOC, nor do HQ units that have fo attached combat units.

[#10_12]*[10.12]* Aircraft, Squadron Ground Support units, and warships exert
no ZOC.

[#10_13]*[10.13]* Informational markers, such as dumps, minefields, airfields,
etc., do not exert a ZOC.

[#10_14]*[10.14]* Units with a Cohesion Level of —26 or worse do not exert
a ZOC.

[#10_15]*[10.15]* Regardless of <<10_11>>, any unit(s) in a hex that total less
than ten Raw Defensive Close Assault Points do not exert a ZOC, whatever the
organizational size of the unit. For this purpose, anti-tank units are always
presumed to be Up Front (see Case <<12_1>>).

[#10_16]*[10.16]* The non-Phasing Player must inform the Phasing Player whether
or nota particular unit exerts a Zone of Control if that unit could exert a Zone
into a hex and a unit belonging to the Phasing Player either begins a Movement
Segment in that hex or is moved into that hex.

[#10_2]*[10.2]*
=== EFFECTS OF ZONES OF CONTROL

[#10_21]*[10.21]* ZOC's extend into all hexes on the gamemap, with the following exceptions:

[loweralpha]

. ZOC's do not extend through All-Sea hexsides,
Major River hexsides, or Lake hexsides; and

. ZOC's do not extend through Escarpment hexsides; and

. ZOC's do not extend into any adjacent hex into
which the unit wishing to exert the ZOC could not enter from its present
location. (Example: a Tank Battalion could not exert a ZOC into a Salt Marsh hex
unless there was a Track or Road connecting the two hexes.)

[#10_22]*[10.22]* There is no cost in CP's to enter an Enemy
ZOC. However, see Section <<10_3>>.

[#10_23]*[10.23]* A unit must cease movement upon entering an
Enemy-controlled hex. The moving unit may not exit that Enemy-controlled hex
until the next Movement Segment (within that Operations Stage or in the next
Operations Stage). If a unit begins a Movement Segment in an Enemycontrolled hex
it may leave that ZOC, at a cost in CP's to Break Off (<<8_7>>). Units may not be
retreated into a hex in an Enemy ZOC (exception: see Case <<10_26>>).

[#10_24]*[10.24]* No units may be moved directly from one Enemy-controlled hex
into another Enemycontrolled hex. However, terrain permitting, a unit may always
"advance" into an adjacent hex vacated by an Enemy unit as a result of Combat,
Retreat Before Assault, or Reaction. Such advance is taken as part of movement
in the ensuing Movement Segment and costs CP's. (There is no literal Advance
After Combat rule in CNA; this rule is simply an exception to the
no-movementinto-Enemy-ZOC's rule).

[#10_25]*[10.25]* Friendly units may move through hexes adjacent to an Enemy
combat unit that are not controlled by that Enemy unit's ZOC. (See Cases 10.1
and <<10_21>>).

[#18_26]*[18.26]* For al/ movement purposes, the presence of a Friendly combat
unit in a hex negates the effect of an Enemy ZOC. Friendly ZOC's never affect
Friendly units.

[#10_27]*[10.27]* Opposing units exerting ZOC's on each other are considered to
be in each other's ZOC.  Furthermore, if opposing units exert a ZOC into the
same hex that hex is considered to be controlled by both Players.

[#10_28]*[10.28]* There is no additional effect when more than one unit exerts a
ZOC into a given hex.

[#20_29]*[20.29]* Truck Convoys may not enter an Enemy ZOC unless such hex is
already occupied by a Friendly combat unit. Furthermore, no noncombat unit
(i.e., bare HQ's, Engineers, Air Squadron Ground Support Units, etc.) may ever
enter an unoccupied hex in an enemy ZOC voluntarily. If such a unit is alone in
an Enemy ZOC at any time during the Enemy Movement/Combat Phase and it has no
strength of any type, such Friendly non-combat unit is Captured.

[#10_3]*[10.3]*
=== ZOC COMBAT REQUIREMENTS (HOLDING OFF)

[#10_31]*[10.31]* All hexes containing Enemy units exerting Zones of Control on
Friendly combat units must be attacked—either by Artillery Barrage or by Close
Assault.

[note]
====
A Probe (see Case <<15_9>>) satisfies this requirement if the basic differential is -4 or better.
====

[#10_32]*[10.32]* As an exception to <<10_31>>, if the Friendly units in such
Enemy ZOC consist solely of Artillery, anti-tank, or anti-aircraft (or
non-combat) units, or there are other type units but they are pinned (<<12_42>>),
these units do not have to attack as in Case <<10_31>>.

[#20_33]*[20.33]* Players may use a special "Holding Off" Artillery Barrage to
satisfy the requirements of 10.31. (For experienced gamers, this is a
sophisticated version of "Soaking Off".) Thus a Friendly Division that is in the
ZOC of Enemy units from two different hexes may choose to Hold Off one of those
hexes and Close Assault the other.

[#16_34]*[16.34]* To perform a Holding Off Barrage, a Friendly Player must
Barrage an Enemy hex with at least as many Actual Barrage Strength Points (i.e.,
Barrage Rating x TOE Strength + 10) as there are individual non-Gun (i.e.,
Artillery, AntiTank or AA units) Enemy battalion-equivalent combat units (units
with /ess than 1 Stacking Point and Gun units do not count) in that hex.
Remember, an Enemy Division may consist of, say, eleven battalion-equivalent
units, so the Friendly Barraging Player would need 11 Actual Barrage Points to
perform a Holding Off action against such a Division.

[#10_35]*[10.35]* If, according to the precepts of <<10_34>>, a Friendly Phasing
Player can not Hold Off Enemy units ina given hex he must Close Assault
that hex.  (Remember Case <<10_32>>). There is no minimum point requirement for
a Close Assault.

[#10_36]*[10.36]* If, for any reason, a unit can neither Assault nor Hold Off an
Enemy unit, that Friendly unit must Retreat three hexes (playing all CP's for
such movement) and earn three Disorganization Points, in addition to any
garnered by the retreat. Such retreat must place the retreating unit three hexes
distant from the Enemy unit (no doubling back, etc.) and may not be made through
any hexes in Enemy Zones of Control. If forced to enter an Enemy ZOC the unit
Surrenders in entirety.

[#11_0]
== THE COMBAT SYSTEM

COMMENTARY:

CNA is an operational-level simulation, and it has been the history of
operational games to have combat systems of a generally simple level (cf.
Panzergruppe Guderian, Battle of the Bulge, even War in Europe). However, the
combat system in CNA is a multi-layered sequence consisting of several steps,
all of which have been designed to take into effect not only the characteristics
of the individual types of weapons (small arms fire vis a vis indirect artillery
fire, etc.) but also the uniqueness of desert warfare. This imparts a tactical
flavor to combat without resort to actual play-outs of combat on a tactical
level. Much has been abstracted (the major abstraction being artillery ranges),
but there is still a wealth of information available as to relative strengths,
compositions and capabilities of the different units. Above all, we have
attempted to instill a "combined arms" imperative in the combat system, with the
result that unit composition is as important as actual strength. The CNA combat
system requires some mathematical dexterity, but most of all it requires a good
sense of organization and planning. Most

Players will enter combat "blind", knowing little about the Enemy. Knowing what
to hold back and where to assign guns and tanks is all important.

The Combat System may appear complex, but it is simply a matter of following the
sequence and making the necessary calculations as you progress.  This section
should be referred to when undergoing combat, at least until the mechanics of
the sequence are well within the grasp of the Players.

GENERAL RULE:

During each Combat Segment, combat is mandatory between opposing units in
adjacent controlled hexes. There are four basic types of combat activity:
Barrage, Retreat Before Assault (nonPhasing units only), Anti-Armor, and Close
Assault (offensive for the Phasing Player's units and defensive for the
non-Phasing Player's units).  Prior to the resolution of each type of combat,
the Phasing and non-Phasing Players secretly allocate units to perform one or
more of these activities, as they choose. The relative ability of a unit to
perform a combat activity is a function of its basic rating for that activity
modified by its current TOE Strength Level (excepting Retreat Before Combat,
which any unpinned units may perform).  Each activity necessitates the
expenditure of Capability Points.

This Section discusses combat in general terms, as well as showing how the
combat ratings are used.  Combat resolution for each type of activity is
discussed specifically in Sections <<12_0>> (Barrage) <<13_0>> (Retreat Before
Combat), <<14_0>> (Anti-Armor Fire), and <<15_0>> (Close Assault).

PROCEDURE:

Once all movement has ceased (i.e., the Phasing Player's movement and the
non-Phasing Player's reactions), combat may occur. During a Combat Segment, the
Phasing Player must attack all Enemy-occupied hexes which have units exerting
Zones of Control upon Friendly units (see <<10_3>>). Any other Enemy units in
hexes adjacent to Friendly units may be attacked subject to terrain restrictions
on combat. After determining which units are undergoing combat, each Player
decides which Gun-class units in hexes adjacent to Enemy units will be placed in
a Forward position and which will be considered in a Back position (see Case
<<12_1>>). This is done "secretly," each Player simply noting on either the TOE
sheets or some other piece of paper the appropriate positions of his guns. Gun
units remain in their specified positions throughout that Combat Segment.
Players now engage in Barrage. Each Player decides which of his units will
Barrage which Enemy hexes (see Case <<12_2>>), noting the targets secretly on a
piece of paper. Any adjacent hex containing Enemy units may be barraged. Both
Players now Barrage individually, hex by hex, but casualties and Pinned results
are taken after a// Barrages have been completed. Players should note here any
Barrages undertaken as Holding Off actions to satisfy ZOC combat requirements
(see Case <<10_3>>).

The non-Phasing Player may now Retreat Before Assault with any of his units that
were not Pinned during Barrage.

Both Players now (and secretly, again) assign their units (including forward
Gun-class units) to AntiArmor and/or Close Assault roles. Any unit with an
Anti-Armor rating may be assigned to the former. An individual unit may be
assigned to both Anti-Armor Assault and Close Assault. This is done by dividing
the TOE Strength Points of that unit between both types of Assault. However, an
individual TOE Strength Point may never be so divided. Players may also choose
to withhold un pinned Armor or Gun-class units out of combat (for whatever
reason they so desire; usually ammunition costs). The strengths of these units
is not considered; see Cases <<15_29>> and <<15_8>>.

Both sides now engage in Anti-Armor Fire, each side firing at the other's
"armor", All results from Anti-Armor Fire are taken before proceeding to Close
Assault. All Armor units assigned to AntiArmor or Close Assault are subject to
Anti-Armor Fire. Withheld armor units are not subject to such fire. Thus, tanks
assigned to Close Assault roles may be destroyed during Anti-Armor Fire.

After assessing losses from Anti-Armor Fire the Phasing Player engages in Close
Assault against the non-Phasing Player. Only units assigned to Close Assault are
used to determine the Assault Differential (however, see Case <<14_26>>).
Remember to adjust Close Assault Strengths for losses incurred from Anti-Armor
Fire. Players now take casualties from Close Assault, place "Engaged" markers
as needed and conduct any Retreats mandated by the Close Assault CRT. This
concludes the Combat Segment, and the Phasing Player may now release any
reserves he wishes and proceeds back to his Movement Segment (if he so desires).

The above sequence is general. For a complete description of all activities,
consult Sections <<12_0>> through <<15_0>>

CASES:

[#11_1]
=== UNIT COMBAT CHARACTERISTICS

There are seven Land Unit Combat characteristics: Barrage, Vulnerability,
Anti-Armor, Armor Protection, Offensive Close Assault, Defensive Close Assault,
and Anti-Aircraft. (The individual OA Sheets carry all the information for each
unit in the game; the unit counters do not carry this information.) Every Land
unit has been given a Rating (or a Factor used to multiply by TOE Strength) of
its capabilities and relative strength in each of these areas. (See Designer's
Notes for a discussion of how these ratings were arrived at). These are
described in Case <<3_5>>.

[#11_11]*[11.11]* The Barrage Rating is the measure of a unit's ability to
engage in long-range indirect fire.  Only Artillery units possess a Barrage
rating.

[#14_12]*[14.12]* The Vulnerability Rating is an abstraction of a Gun unit's
susceptibility to Close Assault, or how far back from the front it can operate
without being affected by direct fire. All Guns — i.e., Artillery and Anti-Tank
units — possess Vulnerability Ratings.

[#11_13]*[11.13]* The Anti-Armor Rating is a measure of a unit's ability to
engage in direct fire with and destroy opposing Armored units.

[#11_14]*[11.14]* Armor Protection is a measure of a unit's armor, its strength
and thickness vis a vis opposing Anti-Armor Ratings. Units that have Armor
Protection Ratings are usually limited to Tanks, Recce and Armored Car units,
and Self-Propelled Artillery.

[#11_15]*[11.15]* The two Close Assault Ratings are a measure of a unit's
ability to perform (Offensive Assault) and defend against (Defensive Assault)
Close Assault combat.

[#11_16]*[11.16]* The AA Rating of a unit is its ability to shoot down planes.
For the most part, only AA/Flak units have this rating, but it can be found on
other units. E.g., some Tanks have AA/Flak capability, as do some HQ units.

[#11_2]*[11.2]*
=== CAPABILITY POINT

EXPENDITURES FOR COMBAT

[#11_21]*[11.21]* A non-Phasing unit expends three CP's if
it undergoes an attack. Exception: see Case <<11_27>>.
This will occur under the following circumstances:

[loweralpha]

. If it Barrages an Enemy (Phasing) unit; or

. If it undergoes any form of Assault (AntiTank, Close) except Probe (2 CP's). This includes
the situation where a unit Retreats Before Assault into a Friendly hex that is
later assaulted.

. If it undergoes a Holding Off Barrage (see <<10_3>>).

[#11_22]*[11.22]* A Phasing unit expends five CP's to perform any form of
attack, other than a Probe. It can never expend more than five CP's in a given
Combat, although if it engages in a different (new) round of combat after
completing the first round of combat it will (possibly) expend more CP's. The
following is a list of circumstances under which a combat unit expends 5 CP's to
attack:

1. It Barrages an Enemy unit; or

2. It engages in Anti-Armor or Close Assault.

[#11_23]*[11.23]* A Phasing unit expends fewer than 5 CP's under the following
circumstances:

1. It Probes an Enemy unit (2 CP's), or

2. It undergoes Barrage (3 CP's).

[#11_24]*[11.24]* A non-Phasing unit never expends more than fhree CP's in
combat in a given Combat Segment, regardless of what happens to it in that
Segment. A Phasing unit never expends more than five CP's in a given Combat
Segment. See <<11_27>>.

[#11_25]*[11.25]* CP expenditures apply to a@// units in a hex, even if certain
units did not participate in combat in any way. This applies to Phasing and
non-Phasing units. Thus, if the Commonwealth Player Close Assaults with his
entire 7th Armored Division, but chooses to withhold the Ist KRRC, the entire
division expends five CP's, including the non-participating Ist KRRC.
Concurrently, if the Artillery units of the 7th Armored Division had barraged
Enemy units and then the 7th Armored did nothing else, the entire division (if
it were all in the same hex) would still expend 5 CP's.

[#11_26]*[11.26]* Generally, Phasing units will expend 5 CP's and non-Phasing
units 3 CP's ina given combat Segment, except where a Phasing unit chooses to
Probe. However, remember, if units in the hex with the Probing units Barrage the
Enemy units those units expend 5 CP's, regardless of the Probe attempt.

[#11_27]*[11.27]* A unit defending against a full (nonProbe) Close Assault in
which the final Assault Differential is minus four or worse expends only one CP
to defend.

[#11_3]*[11.3]*
=== CALCULATION OF COMBAT STRENGTHS

The Combat Strengths of a unit for a given function (Assault, Anti-Tank, etc.)
are stated in Actual Strength Points, which are arrived at by multiplying the
TOE Strength by the Combat Rating for that particular function and then dividing
this Raw Strength by fen (except for A.A). This does not apply to a unit's Armor
Protection or Vulnerability Ratings, which remain constant and are applied and
used differently.

[#14_31]*[14.31]* The relative strength value of units during combat (with some
exceptions noted' below) is expressed in Actual Stength Points. These Actual
Points are either applied directly to a hex or unit (as in Barrage or
Anti-Armor) or compared with the Enemy forces (as in Close Assauit or Probe).
Case <<12_54>> is a minor exception to this rule.

[#11_32]*[11.32]* The formula for arriving at the Actual Strength of a unit is
as follows: Combat Rating x TOE Strength used + 10 = Actual Strength Points.
Players should round any decimals to the nearest whole number: 11.4 = 11,
11.5 = 12.

[#11_33]*[11.33]* A unit that has less than .5 Actual Points (or, to state it
differently, has only four or less Raw Points) has an Actual Strength of zero
(0). However, if both sides of a Close Assault or Probe have less than fen Raw
Points Players should use the Raw Points as if they were Actual Points. See also
Case <<15_51>>. Raw Points are the numbers arrived at by multiplying the Combat
Rating by the TOE Strength.

[#11_34]*[11.34]* All Raw Points are totaled before dividing by 10 for Actual
Strength. This applies for units within a hex as well as units attacking from
different hexes (against the same target).

[#11_35]*[11.35]* As an example, we will demonstrate how to determine a variety
of combat strengths for an entire Division, using the German 90th Leichte
Division as an example (see the OA Sheets for this unit). We will assume the
unit is at full strength and that all units assigned are currently attached to
the division and that there are no other units attached.

The Axis Player wishes to use the Artillery in the 90th to Barrage the enemy; it
has the 361 Artillery Battalion and the 190th Artillery Rgt. to do this.  The
361 has 3 TOE points of 9-rating Barrage, or 27 Raw Points. The 190 has 3 TOE of
18 Rating Barrage plus 3 TOE points of 9-Rating Barrage, for a total of 81 Raw
points (27 + 54 = 81). Thus a combined total of 108 Raw Barrage Points is
available, which equals 11 Actual Barrage Points (108 + 10 = 10.8, rounded
up to 11). The 90th may now Barrage with those 11 Actual Points against the
enemy. The Axis Player could also split up its TOE Strength if he wishes, using
2 TOE points of the 361st (or 2 Actual Points) against one unit and the other
TOE point against a different unit. There are restrictions involved, and the
Section on Barrage (<<12_0>>) covers them all.

Skipping to Close Assault — for demonstration purposes — we see that the 90th
Leichte has seven Infantry Battalions: the entire 155th Schutzen Regt. (3
battalions), the two battalions of thé 361st Afrika Regt plus the III/225 and
the III/347 Battalions. The 155th provides 42 Raw Points, the 361st provides 9
Raw Points (it would provide 18 on defense) and the two odd battalions an
additional 14, for a grand total of 65 Raw Offensive Close Assault Points
(excluding any Artillery firing in Assault), or 7 Actual Points (6.5 rounded
up). As above, these points could be split, by dividing the TOE points, or
assigning different battalions to assault different hexes, etc. Each separate
Close Assault is determined individually.

[#11_36]*[11.36]* It will behoove the Players to keep a running track of all Raw
and Actual Point totals for his Parent organizations on his TOE Sheets, so he
knows at a glance what is available and what his strengths are. These strengths
are to be kept secret from opposing Players, revealed only upon attack.

[#11_37]*[11.37]* AA/Flak Actual Points are calculated the same as other
strengths, with one major difference. As with anti-armor, close assault, and
barrage calculations, multiply the TOE Strength by the AA Rating. But do not
divide by ten; the raw AA Points are the Actual AA Points. Thus, an AA unit with
a rating of 4 and a strength of 2 would have 8 AA Points.

[#11_38]*[11.38]* The only combat ratings that do not use the above formula
(multiplying by TOE Strength, etc.) are the Vulnerability and Armor Protection
ratings. These ratings are used to determine the number of gun and armor losses
and are discussed in Cases <<14_42>> and <<15_85>>.

[#12_0]
== BARRAGE (Artillery Combat)

GENERAL RULE:

Barrage is the first "step" of the Combat Segment. Any combat or HQ unit with a
Barrage Rating (and enough ammunition) may Barrage enemy units in adjacent
hexes. Each Player simply determines how many Actual Barrage Points he has,
selects his targets, and fires his guns at the selected targets, subtracting
ammunition as used.  At the beginning of the Combat Segment, all Artillery units
are placed in either of two positions: Forward or Back. The position of a gun
unit dictates whether it may coordinate fire with other artillery units and
whether it may split its fire to Barrage more than one target.

PROCEDURE:

After all Targets have been designated and Barrage Points assigned to those
Targets (see <<12_23>>), Barrage is resolved. The effects of Barrage are
simultaneous, in that all results are applied after all Barrages are completed,
but each individual Target is barraged separately, in any order the Players
desire. To resolve a Barrage, the Barraging Player states his Target (either by
type or number, as explained in Case <<12_24>>, or by specific unit I.D., if he
has that information), states the number of Actual Barrage Points (see Case
<<11_32>>) directed at that Target and then consults the Barrage Results Table
(12.6), selecting the appropriate portion depending on the type of unit being
fired at (Gun, Armor, or Infantry), He then rolls two dice, combining the
results such that the larger die's result is stated first and the small die's
second (e.g., a "27"/*5" is considered a "25").  The result is cross
referenced with the Target type and the Actual Barrage Points expended. The
Player then repeats the process to determine whether any trucks in the hex are
affected. Results are noted, and applied at the end of the Barrage Step. The
firing Player also subtracts ammunition expended as his guns are fired.

Note: "Holding-off" Barrages are resolved in the same fashion as normal] Barrage
(see Case <<10_3>>).

[#12_1]
=== ARTILLERY POSITIONS

[#12_11]*[12.11]* Artillery units, when they are involved in combat, must be
placed either Forward or Back.  The entire unit, regardless of its size (or
whether, as in some artillery units, it has more than one type of gun) must be
placed in the same position.

[#12_12]*[12.12]* The position of an artillery unit may not be changed during a
Combat Segment; it may be changed only at the beginning of a Combat Segment,
when the Players must decide their gun positions.(See the Sequence of Play.)
Positions of guns may be noted on the TOE Sheets or on any handy piece of paper.

[#12_13]*[12.13]* Artillery units in a Forward position may coordinate fire with
other artillery units (in a Forward position) from the same or different hexes.
i.e., they may combine its Barrage Strength with that of other units directed at
a given target.

[#12_14]*[12.14]* fralian units in a Forward position may co-ordinate Barrage
fire only with units within the same hex.

[#12_15]*[12.15]* Artillery units in a Forward position may split their TOE
Strength and attack more than one target, directing a portion of its TOE
Strength against one unit and another portion against a different unit (target).

[#12_16]*[12.16]* Artillery units in a Back position may not coordinate fire
with any other artillery unit nor may they split fire. If a Heavy Weapons unit
has Barrage capability and its guns are back, the entire unit is considered back
and thus cannot participate in anti-armor or Close Assault combat.

[#12_17]*[12.17]* All non-Phasing Players' Guns in a Forward position are
subject to losses from Close Assault, even if they do not participate in such an
assault. See Section <<15_8>> for details on losses. All non-Phasing (Forward or
Back) are subject to Close Assault losses if the Close Assault by the Phasing
Player is conducted in the Overrun Columns of the Close Assault CRT (see Case
<<15_84>>).

[#12_18]*[12.18]* Artillery placed in a Forward position may participate in
Anti-Tank or Close Assault in that same Combat Segment, providing they have the
necessary Ratings and Ammunition. However, Artillery participating in an
Offensive Close Assault has its Vulnerability rating reduced by 50% (%)
rounded up. Thus a unit with a 7 Vulnerability Rating would have a 4
Vulnerability Rating if it chose to participate in Offensive Close Assault.
Note: the higher a unit's Vulnerability Rating, the /ess vulnerable it is.

[#12_19]*[12.19]* Artillery units used in an Anti-Armor (14.0) role assume an
automatic Vulnerability Rating of ‘2'.

[#12_2]
=== TARGET SELECTION

[#12_21]*[12.21]* Target Selection involves the principle that a Parent
Formation is comprised of one or more battalion- (or company-) sized units.
Thus, the 90th Leichte Division (German) is composed of thirteen battalion-sized
combat units.

[#12_22]*[12.22]* For Barrage purposes, all (with the following exceptions)
counters, whether attached or not, in a hex that bear a Stacking Point indicator
are targets. This includes engineer units but excludes Trucks, SGSU's, etc. The
exception is all HQ's without TOE Strength Points or with only points with
parenthesized Close Assault Ratings. In addition, Dummy Tank formations (see
Case <<16_4>>) and Commonwealth warships may be considered targets.

[#12_23]*[12.23]* Barrage is directed at a specific target combat unit (as
defined in <<12_22>>). The Barraging Player states which hexes he wishes to
Barrage from. The opposing Player then states how many targets (individual
battalions/companies) are in each hex adjacent to a hex which is firing. He also
states whether each Target is a Gun class, Armor Class, or Infantry Class
unit—see Case <<3_2>>. He does not have to state the strength, exact type or
designation of any unit. However, if a Player knows that a specific unit is in a
hex under Barrage (through Patrol or previous combat) he may designate that
specific unit as a target.

[#12_24]*[12.24]* Except as stated in the last sentence of <<12_23>> the Barraging
Player fires "blind", stating only that he is firing at a given type of unit as
target. For purposes of resolving Barrage, Players should assign, for a Barrage
Step, ID numbers to each type of unit. E.g., Infantry #1, Infantry #2,
etc. Thus, the Barraging Player states he is directing "X" number of Actual Barrage Points against
Target Infantry #2.

[#12_3]
=== EFFECTS OF TERRAIN AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS ON BARRAGE

[#12_31]*[12.31]* Artillery units may Barrage Enemy targets in any adjacent hex,
regardless of terrain. Artillery units may not Barrage non-occupied hexes
(however, see Case <<12_5>>),

[#12_32]*[12.32]* No target may be barraged more than once in a Combat Segment
from each adjacent enemy occupied hex. Of course, Artillery units ina Forward
position may combine Barrage strengths in one Barrage against a given Target.

[#12_33]*[12.33]* Certain terrain affects artillery fire in that if a Target
unit is in that terrain the Column (Barrage Points) used to resolve Barrage for
that unit is shifted a specific number of rows "left,", benefitting the
defender. Thus, if a towed artillery unit were being Barraged as a target ina
Level Two Fortified position (Clear Terrain) by twelve Barrage Points (the 11-12
column on the Barrage CRT) the Barrage would be resolved on the 7-8 column,
because a Level Two Fortification benefits the defender two column shifts.

[#12_34]*[12.34]* Column shifts — and terrain benefits — are not cumulative. The
defender gets the benefit of only the best defensive position or terrain. See
the Terrain Effects Chart for all terrain benefits and column shifts. Remember,
column shifts always benefit the defender. Shifts worse than 1-2 column mean the
Barrage had no effect.

[#12_35]*[12.35]* There are no Line of Sight restrictions in CNA regarding
Artillery. Artillery units may Barrage any unit to which they are adjacent.

[#12_4]
=== EXPLANATION OF ARTILLERY BARRAGE RESULTS

[#12_41]*[12.41]* The Artillery Barrage Table (12.6) is a CRT that covers
artillery fire against personnel, Armor, Artillery and concurrent effects on
Trucks. Regardless of the target (see Case <<12_5>>) the Player will use the
Artillery Barrage Table for his results.

[#12_42]*[12.42]* The Artillery Barrage Table uses a twodice sequential
read-out; i.e., a ‘3' anda ‘4' are 34, reading the larget die first. These die
rolls comprise the columns of the Table, while the total Barrage Points applied
to the Target comprise the rows of the table. The "meat" of the table — the
center portion — is the results, divided according to target type.

[#12_43]*[12.43]* The Player notes the number of Barrage Points being fired,
adjusts the column left if necessary and rolls the two dice. He then
crossreferences those two numbers under the correct target type (personnel,
tanks, or artillery) and obtains the result.

[#12_44]*[12.44]* If a result of "P" is obtained, the entire target unit is
"Pinned", Pinned units may not move for the remainder of that Combat Segment,
nor may they engage in Anti-Armor Fire or Close Assault. Pinned units are
subject to casualties(see Case <<15_12>>). Place a Pinned marker on all Pinned
units; remove the marker at the end of the Combat Segment. "Pin" results from
Barrage do not occur againstGun-class units or Artillery HQ units.

[#12_45]*[12.45]* A number as a result (e.g., 1 or 2) indicates the number of
TOE Strength Points are destroyed by the Barrage. Casualties are taken after all
Barrages are completed.

[#12_46]*[12.46]* Trucks may be affected by Artillery Fire.  Every time a Player
fires at a given target, be it Infantry, Armor or whatever, he must roll a
second time to determine whether any Trucks attached to the Target unit and/or
its parent unit (if any) are affected. Thus, if a Player has 10 Barrage Points
firing at Infantry he rolls once for the effect on the target and if , and there
are any Trucks in the same hex as the unit being barraged then the Barraging
Player rolls again on the 10 point row under Trucks to see how many, if any
Trucks were destroyed. The choice of Trucks to be removed is up to the Defender,
but losses must be distributed as evenly as possible among types of trucks and
types of cargo. Players should note that when barraging Infantry, if those TOE
points are already in Trucks (motorized) those Trucks are also eliminated, in
addition to any Trucks actually noted on the Artillery Barrage Table.

[#12_5]
=== BARRAGE AGAINST FACILITIES

[#12_51]*[12.51]* Artillery may be used to Barrage facilities, rather than
actual units, in an effort to reduce their effectiveness. Such Barrage may be
directed against Major Cities, Fortifications, Roads, Railroads, Supply Dumps,
and Air Facilities.

[#12_52]*[12.52]* Barrage against Facilities follows all the rules of normal
Barrage, with the exception that the Target designated is the specific facility.

[#12_53]*[12.53]* In barrages directed against any Facility other than a Supply
Dump or Air Facility the Players use Air Bombardment Table (41.5), with the
exception that they refer to thé Artillery Barrage Points column in determining
the effect of the Barrage. See Case <<41_3>>.

[#12_54]*[12.54]* In Barrages directed against Supply Dumps or Air Facilities
the Player uses Air Bombardment Table (<<41_5>>); however, he uses his Raw Barrage
Points (not Actual) to correspond to the Bombload column. Thus 78 Raw Barrage
Points would use the 41-80 column. Remember, do not use Actual Strength Barrage
Points; use Raw Strength.

[#12_55]*[12.55]* Off-Shore Bombardment may be used to Barrage facilities; see
Case <<30_12>>.

[#12_6]
=== ARTILLERY BARRAGE TABLE

(See Charts and Tables)

[#13_0]
== RETREAT BEFORE ASSAULT

GENERAL RULE:

Retreat Before Assault takes place after all Barrages have been completed. Any
non-Phasing units that are not Pinned may Retreat Before Assault in the step
designated for such movement.  Retreat Before Assault is movement and consumes
CP's; it should not be confused with Reaction (<<8_5>>).

[#13_1]
=== WHICH UNITS MAY RETREAT BEFORE ASSAULT

Any non-Phasing Unit that is not Pinned may Retreat Before Assault. Units with a
Cohesion Level of ~26 or worse may not Retreat Before Assault.

[#13_2]
=== HOW TO OF RETREAT BEFORE ASSAULT

[#13_21]*[13.21]* Retreat Before Assault is Voluntary Movement and is handled
exactly as other types of Movement. It expends CP's (and Fuel, for vehicles),
and vehicles are subject to Breakdown.  In addition, there are certain other
restrictions, as listed below.

[#13_22]*[13.22]* Non-Phasing units in the Zone of Control of an Enemy unit must
pay the cost to Break Off (Contact or Engaged) as stated in Case <<8_6>>.

[#13_23]*[13.23]* Non-Phasing units that begin a Retreat Before Assault Step
adjacent to an Enemy combat unit may expend as many CP's in Retreating as
desired.

[#13_24]*[13.24]* Non-Phasing units that do not begin a Retreat Before Assault
Step adjacent to an Enemy combat unit may not expend more than four CP's (or
move one hex, whichever is greater) in a Retreat Before Assault.

[#13_25]*[13.25]* During a Retreat Before Assault units may expend CP's only to
move; they may not perform any other function except blowing supply dumps (see
Cases <<54_14>> and <<32_3>>).

[#13_26]*[13.26]* As in normal Movement, units must cease Retreat Before Assault
when they enter an Enemy Zone of Control. They may not Retreat directly from one
Enemy ZOC into another, and if they cannot avoid this restriction they may not
Retreat Before Assault.

[#13_27]*[13.27]* Retreat Before Assault is voluntary; as such it is handled
somewhat differently from retreats mandated by the Close Assault CRT (<<15_82>>).

[#13_28]*[13.28]* Units that Retreat Before Assault into Friendly-occupied
Enemy-controlled hexes, or into any hex that is attacked in the ensuing
AntiArmor and Close Assault sub-segments are affected by such combat. They will
take — and are susceptible to — Anti-Armor Fire, but they may not direct
Anti-Armor fire against Enemy units.  They may not add their Offensive or
Defensive Close Assault Ratings into the Assault combat in that hex, but their
TOE Strength Points are included when taking percentage losses from that
Assault.

[#14_0]
== ANTI-ARMOR COMBAT

GENERAL RULE:

Anti-Armor Combat is fire by units with an AntiArmor Rating directed against
Enemy units with an Armor Protection Rating. Anti-Armor Combat occurs before
Close Assault, and all losses from Anti-Armor are taken before proceeding to
Close Assault, irrespective of what type of combat the armored unit has been
assigned to. Units may be assigned to either Anti-Armor or Close Assault; or
Players may split the TOE Strength Points within a unit and assign some to one
and some to another — but never to both in the same Combat Segment. The Player
then determines the Actual Anti-Armor Strength Points firing at a hex, he
consults the Anti-Armor CRT and based on the number of Damage Points earned vis
a vis the Armor Protection Rating of the Enemy units. Units specifically
withheld from both Anti-Armor and Close Assault are not affected by Anti-Armor
fire.

PROCEDURE:

During the Anti-Armor Combat Step, both Players engage in Anti-Armor fire,
regardless of which Player is the Phasing Player. All AntiArmor fire is
simultaneous (i.e., all results are applied after all attacks have been
resolved).

Anti-Armor fire is directed against a specific hex designated by the Phasing
Player and affects only those units in that hex that have an Armor Protection
Rating (see Case <<14_23>>) which have not been withheld. Each Player totals his
Actual AntiArmor Strength Points firing in that hex (see Case 11.32), rolls two
dice, and consults the AntiArmor Combat Results Table (14.6) to see how many
Damage Points he has inflicted. These points are then applied by the owning
(fired upon, so to speak) Player to remove (eliminate) TOE Points with Armor
Protection Ratings in that hex (see Case <<14_4>>, Assessing Anti-Armor Damage),
and a Destroyed Tank marker is placed in the hex.

Each Anti-Armor attack is performed separately in any order the Players wish, as
all results are only applied after all fire is complete.

[#14_1]
=== WHICH UNITS MAY PARTICIPATE IN ANTI-ARMOR COMBAT

[#14_11]*[14.11]* Anti-Armor Combat pits units with AntiArmor Ratings firing
against targets that have Armor Protection Ratings. Only units assigned to the
Anti-Armor Sub-Segment of the Combat Segment may fire their Anti-Armor Points,
and only those units actually committed to Anti-Armor or Close Assault are
affected by such fire (see Case <<14_12>>).  Units with Armor Protection Ratings
withheld from combat are not affected by Anti-Armor fire.

[#14_12]*[14.12]* Anti-Armor fire by the Phasing Player is directed at an entire
adjacent hex (not specific target units) occupied by Enemy units. Anti-armor
fire by the non-Phasing Player is directed against any Phasing Armor Class units
assaulting the hex.  Units that are in a hex at which Anti-Armor fire is
directed that have Retreated Before Assault are affected by Anti-Armor fire
(although they may not use Anti-Armor fire against Enemy units) and they may not
be withheld from the effects of AntiArmor fire.

[#14_13]*[14.13]* Any artillery unit with an Anti-Armor Rating that is in a Back
position (see Case <<12_1>>) may not participate in (nor is it affected by)
AntiArmor fire. Anti-Armor guns are always Forward when firing.

[#14_14]*[14.14]* Artillery units used in an Anti-Armor role have an automatic
Vulnerability Rating of 2.

[#14_2]
=== RESTRICTIONS ON ANTI-ARMOR COMBAT

[#14_21]*[14.21]* Units withheld from both Anti-Armor and Assault Combat are not
affected by AntiArmor fire (although defending units withheld may be affected by
Close Assault).

[#14_22]*[14.22]* No hex may be attacked by Anti-Armor fire more than once in a
Combat Segment, but units from different hexes may direct Anti-Armor fire into
the same Target hex, combining their Anti-Armor Strength into one total
strength.

[#14_23]*[14.23]* The Player directing the fire may not know whether the
opposing Player actually has any armor in a hex; that is his problem to
determine. If the "defending" Player has no units with Armor Protection Ratings
in a hex being fired on by Anti-Armor the "attacking/firing" Player may reassign
up to % (rounded down) of those AntiArmor points to Close Assault for that
Combat Segment. Only when there are no defending Armor units in a Target hex may
this occur.

[#14_24]*[14.24]* Ammunition for removed as expended.

Anti-Armor fire is

[#14_25]*[14.25]* Certain terrain influences the effectiveness of Anti-Armor
fire, and these effects are noted on the Terrain Effects Chart (see Case
<<8_37>>) and in Case <<14_3>>. All column adjustments are made before firing.

[#14_26]*[14.26]* Remember, a Player may divide a unit's TOE Strength Points
between Anti-Armor or Assault, but he may not use a given TOE Strength Point for
both in the same Segment.

[#14_3]
=== TERRAIN EFFECTS ON ANTI-ARMOR FIRE

[#14_31]*[14.31]* Certain types of terrain influence the ef fectiveness of
Anti-Armor fire, while certain types of hexsides render Anti-Armor fire
impossible.

[#14_32]*[14.32]* Where the defending armor is in a hex where there is a Terrain
Effect, there is a Column Shift in favor of the Defender; i.e., it lessens the
Anti-Armor firepower of the Attacker. All such effects are listed on the Terrain
Effects Chart (Case <<8_37>>). E.g., if units in a Rough Terrain hex are fired
on by Anti-Armor Fire worth nine Actual Anti-Armor Strength Points the combat is
resolved in the eight column of the Anti-Armor CRT because of the one column
shift.

[#14_33]*[14.33]* The effects of terrain (including fortifications) are not
cumulative; the defending Player must choose the best terrain. However, the
effects of terrain across a hexside are in addition to those within the hex.

[#14_34]*[14.34]* No Anti-Armor fire may be directed from or against Phasing TOE
Strength Points assaulting through Ridges that are not crossed by tracks or
roads, or down a Slope hexside uncrossed by a Road or Track, or down an
Escarpment uncrossed bya Track.

[#14_35]*[14.35]* If a terrain effect shifts the Anti-Armor Strength Point Row
/ower than ‘1', use the "0” row.

[#14_4]
=== ASSESSING ANTI-ARMOR DAMAGE

[#14_41]*[14.41]* All results on the Anti-Armor CRT (see Case <<14_6>>) are in
Damage Points. Damage Points are applied to the Armor Protection Ratings of any
Armor TOE Strength Points in the hex being fired upon,

[#14_42]*[14.42]* The Armor Protection Rating is ,the number of Damage Points that Point
can absorb before it is destroyed. All units comprising Points with an Armor
Protection Rating may be affected by anti-tank fire and thus take losses because
of it.

[#14_43]*[14.43]* The Player undergoing Anti-Armor fire must remove at /eastas
many TOE Strength Points as are affected by absorbing Damage Points.  Thus,
armor units with higher Armor Protection Ratings can absorb more Damage Points
and are thus harder to destroy.

Example: The Commonwealth Player fires five Actual Anti-Armor Strength Points
into a hex containing six TOE Points of Italian M/11's and three TOE Points of
M/13's. The Commonwealth Player rolls a 35 on the dice and earns seven Damage
Points. The Axis Player must remove enough TOE Strength Points to absorb at
least seven Damage Points. He therefore destroys one TOE point of M/13 (3 Armor
Protection Rating) and two M/11's, (2 Armor Protection times 2 = 4) to cover the
necessary seven point absorbtion.

[#14_44]*[14.44]* Armor losses may be taken from any units with an Armor
Protection Rating in the target hex, regardless of whether they were assigned to
AntiArmor or Close Assault. However, Armor units withheld from both types of
combat are not affected by Anti-Armor Fire (see Case <<13_28>>).

[#14_45]*[14.45]* Damage Points in excess of those necessary to destroy a//l
armor units in a hex are ignored.

[#14_46]*[14.46]* Destroyed Tanks are noted with Destroyed Tank Markers, which
cannot move but may be retrieved during the Repair Segment.  Players should
record precisely what each Destroyed Tank marker represents (see Case <<14_5>>).

[#14_47]*[14.47]* Self-propelled guns may absorb antiarmor Damage Points at a
rate equal to their Armor Protection Rating plus their Vulnerability Rating
(modified if necessary if the point is engaging in anti-armor fire, etc.)

[#14_48]*[14.48]* If the owning Player's only TOE Strength Points in the hex
(assaulting or defending against assault) that could be affected by anti-armor
fire are halftracks (i.e., certain motorized axis leg infantry units), the
halftracks double their Armor Protection Rating. Note that losses of halftracks
involve not only the infantry TOE Strength Point but its transporting Truck
Point(s) as well.

[#14_5]
=== CAPTURING ENEMY DESTROYED TANKS

[#14_51]*[14.51]* Friendly Players may capture (and repair) Enemy Tank Units
(only destroyed tanks may be captured; all other destroyed vehicles are removed
immediately).

[#14_52]*[14.52]* If an Enemy Player enters a hex containing a Destroyed Tank
Marker, and there are no other Friendly combat units in that hex, the Enemy must
decide immediately whether to permanently eliminate the Points or thenceforth
consider them captured.

[#14_53]*[14.53]* Captured Destroyed Tanks may be moved three hexes in any
direction by the capturing Player at the instant of capture. The three hexes may
not include Enemy units or Enemy ZOC's; nor may they include impassable terrain.

[#14_54]*[14.54]* Except for <<14_53>>, Destroyed Tanks are treated like any
other unit marked for possible Repair. In the Phasing Player's Repair Phase they
may be towed to a Repair Facility for Maintenance.

[#14_55]*[14.55]* Players should note that there is a subtle difference between
capturing Destroyed Tanks and capturing Broken down Vehicles. Consult Section
<<21_5>> for a discussion of this.

[#14_6]
=== ANTI-ARMOR COMBAT

RESULTS TABLE
(see Charts and Tables)

[#15_0]
== CLOSE ASSAULT

GENERAL RULE:

Close Assault is the last step of the Combat procedure. In Close Assault, the
Phasing Player is the attacker and the non-Phasing Player is the defender. The
Phasing Player may assault any adjacent Enemy-occupied hex, within the terrain
restrictions for Close Assault. Close Assault resolution involves an Assault
Differential, in which the Close Assault Points of the Defender are subtracted
from those of the Attacker; results are expressed in Casualties (either losses
or prisoners) plus Engaged and Retreat results. The Assault Differential may be
modified by terrain, morale, and the effects of Combined Arms. Close Assault
expends ammunition for both sides. A form of modified Close Assault — the Probe
— is discussed in Case <<15_9>>. In Close Assault, the Phasing Player is always
attacking (or assaulting), the nonPhasing Player is defending against the
assault.

PROCEDURE:

Each Player totals his Actual Close Assault Points (either Offensive or
Defensive, depending on whether he is Phasing or non-Phasing) involved in each
separate Close Assault. The non-Phasing (defending) Player then subtracts his
Actual Close Assault Points from the Offensive Actual Close Assault Points of
the Phasing (attacking) Player, obtaining an Assault Differential (a positive or
negative number, or a zero). This Diffrential is then modified by any terrain
effects, morale considerations, and/or difference in unit organizational size
between opposing forces. The Phasing Player then consults the Adjusted Assault
Differential and rolls two dice, reading the dice sequentially: the large die is
read first, then the small die so that a large die roll of 6 and a small die
roll of 3 is 63. The non-Phasing Player does the same, and both consult the
Close Assault Combat Results Table to determine what losses, if any, have
occurred. Such losses, as well as any other results, are taken immediately
before proceeding to the next hex's Close Assault.

CASES:

[#15_1]
=== WHICH UNITS MAY PARTICIPATE IN CLOSE ASSAULT

[#15_11]*[15.11]* All units which possess a Close Assault Rating may use their
ratings to aid in either Offensive Assault or Defense Against Assault. (Units
without Ratings may also participate, even though they add nothing to the point
total; see Case 15.17.)

[#15_12]*[15.12]* Pinned units and units retreated before assault into a hex
under Close Assault attack may not add their Ratings to Defensive Close Assault.
However, the TOE strengths of sucvh defending units are considered for purposes
of determining casualties vis a vis the number of TOE Strength Points in a hex,
a percentage of which will be eliminated. This pertains only to non-Phasing
defending units.

[#45_13]*[45.13]* Guns that are Back are not affected by Close Assault unless
there is an Overrun situation (see Case <<15_86>>). Guns that are Forward may
participate in Offensive or Defensive Close Assault, but their Vulnerability
Ratings may be affected (see Case <<12_18>>).

[#15_14]*[15.14]* Only those units committed to Close Assault (either Offense or
Defense) may add their Ratings to the total Assault Ratings. However, certain
non-Phasing units may be affected by results even though they do not participate
(see Cases <<15_12>>, and <<15_15>>).

[#15_15]*[15.15]* Units that are out of ammunition may not Close Assault, either
offensively or defensively.  However, as in Case <<15_12>>, such units are
considered when determining percentage losses if they are non-Phasing defending
units. Phasing units that are out of ammunition are simply ignored. If all
non-Phasing, defending units in a hex are out of ammunition for Close Assault
purposes, and such units are Assaulted, they automatically Surrender en masse
(i.e., every unit in the hex Surrenders).

[#15_16]*[15.16]* A given Phasing unit may split its TOE Strength Points and
make one Close Assault with some Points and another with the rest, or simply
withhold a portion from any Offensive Close Assault. A non-Phasing Player may
withhoid individual TOE Strength Points, too, but, unlike Phasing units, these
Points are considered in determining percentage losses. Note: The same hex may
never be Close Assaulted more than once per Combat Segment.

[#15_17]*[15.17]* Units with Close Assault Ratings in parentheses may use those
ratings in combat only if they occupy a hex that is unoccupied by combat units.
Such units do not include their TOE Strength for determining losses when they
occupy a hex with combat units un/ess the "losing" Player so wishes.  In such a
case, units with parenthesized ratings may be used to absorb losses but may not
absorb more than 25% of such losses. Note that if a Phasing unit Close Assaults
two hexes in the same Close Assault at the same time, and one of the hexes
contains solely a unit with parenthesized Defensive Close Assault Rating, that
defending unit may use its parenthesized rating in that combat.

[#15_18]*[15.18]* In a Close Assault involving only nonPhasing units with only
parenthesized Close Assault Ratings, if the attacking force has a Raw Offensive
Close Assault strength at least three times the defending parenthesized units'
Raw Defensive Close Assault strength the following two effects apply:

The attacking (Enemy) force ignores the first 20% losses it receives from the
Close Assault; and;

If the defending parenthesized units receive a Close Assault result of
Casualties of 20% or greater, any TOE Strength Points remaining after losses are
assessed are captured (if the Enemy forces survive).

Thus, an AA/Flak unit, for example, may be able to hold off a small Enemy
detachment, but it will most likely be overrun by anything larger.

[#15_2]
=== HOW CLOSE ASSAULT OCCURS

[#15_21]*[15.21]* Phasing units with Offensive Close Assault Ratings may Close
Assault any Enemy units in adjacent hexes, unless Assault is prohibited by
terrain (see Case <<15_3>>). Units assigned to Anti-Armor may sot participate in
Close Assault (however, see Case <<14_23>>).

[#15_22]*[15.22]* The Phasing Player announces which hexes he is assaulting, and
both Players determine their respective total Points, The Phasing Player states
whether his attack constitutes a Close Assault or a Probe (see Case <<15_9>>),
and then each individual assault is resolved sequentially, with results being
taken as they occur.

[#15_23]*[15.23]* An Enemy-occupied hex may be Close Assaulted or Probed only
once per Combat Segment, regardless of the number of units in that
hex. The Phasing Player may not attack some of the units in that hex with one
group and some others with another group.

[#15_24]*[15.24]* As many units from as many hexes as are adjacent to an
Enemy-occupied hex may attack that hex, terrain permitting. Furthermore, a
Phasing unit may Close Assault more than one hex at the same time, as long as
the assaulted hexes are all adjacent to both the hex from which the assault
initiates as well as adjacent to each other. The units that may participate are
listed in Case <<15_1>>.

[#15_25]*[15.25]* Any number of TOE Strength Points from a unit may be assigned
to a given Close Assault (see Case <<15_16>>); however, if the units making a
given Close Assault have committed less than 50% of their available TOE Strength
Points, that Close Assault is automatically considered a Probe and not a Close
Assault. You must Close Assault with 50% or more of your available strength
(although some of those Points may be directed elsewhere) to attack with a
normal Close Assault (see Section <<16_0>>).

Example: A unit with a TOE Strength of 7 uses 2 Points to assault Hex A and |
Point to assault Hex B, withholding the other Point because of ammunition
problems. Neither assault is a full Close Assault; both are Probes. If he used 3
Points against Hex A instead of 2, both would be considered Full Assaults, as he
would have used at least 50% of his available strength somewhere.

[#15_26]*[15.26]* Each Player determines which of his units are participating in
a given Close Assault. Each Player then determines his Actual Close Assault
Strength Points, as stated in Case <<15_4>>. The defending, non-Phasing Player
now subtracts his total from that of the attacking, Phasing Player to achieve
the Basic Assault Differential. Thus, if the Attacker has 6 points and the
Defender eight, the Basic Assault Differential would be -2.

[#15_27]*[15.27]* The Basic Assault Differential is now adjusted, where
necessary, for Terrain Effects (Case <<15_3>>), Morale (Case <<15_6>>), or Units
Size Differential (Case <<15_5>>). These effects result in an adjustment of the
Differential Co/umn (not the Differential number) either one way or the other,
and the cumulative effect of all these upon the Assault Differential produces an
Adjusted Assault Differential, which is then used to determine the results of
the Assault. Consult the Procedure, Section <<15_0>>.  Remember, the two dice
are read sequentially (6 and 2= 62) not mathematically (6 and 2 = 8) in Assault
Combat.

[#15_28]*[15.28]* In Close Assault (and Probe) only, if one Player has fewer
than 5 Raw Assault Points, he is considered to have zero Close Assault Points,
and the Differential is determined from that figure. If each Player has fewer
than 10 Raw Strength Points, the Raw Assault Strength Points are used as if they
were Actual Assault Strength Points (see also Case <<15_51>>).

[#15_29]*[15.29]* There is a possibility that one or both Players do not
allocate any units to Assault. In such cases the following occurs:

. If the Defender/Non-Phasing Player, for any
reason, allocates no units to an Assault ail his units in that hex automatically
retreat three hexes and earn three Disorganization Points (as if it had taken
30% losses) in addition to any DP's earned by the move.

. If the Attacker/Phasing Player does not allocate any units to Assault there is no Assault;
it is ignored. This can occur only under Case 10.31 et seq;

[#18_3]
=== TERRAIN EFFECTS ON CLOSE ASSAULT

[#15_31]*[15.31]* The terrain which a defending unit occupies, or which an
attacking unit has to cross, may increase or decrease the differential in favor
of the attacker/Phasing Player. Players should consult the Terrain Effects Chart
(Case <<8_37>>) fora complete list of all effects on Assault combat.

[#15_32]*[15.32]* The terrain in a hex occupied by a unit is defending against
full Close Assault or Probe either has vo effect on the Differential (e.g.,
Clear Terrain or Sand/Gravel Terrain) or it will decrease the Differential vis a
vir the Attacker by a specific number of columns on. the Assault Differential
Combat Results Table. Thus a unit defending ina Mountain hex against a Close
Assault in which the Basic Assault Differential is + 4 will be Assaulted in the
+ 1 column, because there is a three column shift in favor of the Defender.
(Players should note that a unit defending in a Salt Marsh hex shifts the column
one in favor of the Attacker.)

[#15_33]*[15.33]* Assaults across certain types of hexsides also decrease or
increase the Differential vis a vis the Attacker/Phasing Player; e.g., a unit
attacking through a Wadi hexside has its Attack Differential decreased by one,
in addition to any changes for the hex the defender is in. If any units are
attacking through a given hexside, the Differential is adjusted as if a// units
were attacking through that hexside.

[#15_34]*[15.34]* Certain terrain prohibits full Close Assaults or Probes by
certain types of units.  Motorized units may never assault up an Escarpment,
even if it is crossed by a Track. (You may, of course, take your infantry out of
the Trucks and then Assault.) Motorized units may not assault units defending in
Salt Marshes. Any combat unit in the Zone of Control of an Enemy unit which it
cannot attack must be retreated one hex, unless some other unit attacks that
Enemy unit.

[#15_35]*[15.35]* Terrain effects on Close Assault are cumulataive, with one
exception. The defender may benefit from only one type of hexside (15.33) unless
a unit is actually assaulting through a hexside which contains two types of
terrain. The latter is quite rare, occurring mostly down in the southern areas
of the game-map where some of the wadis run along slope' hexsides. (See
B5810-B5809).

Example: A unit in a Level Two Fortification ina Rough Terrain hex being
assaulted through a Ridge hexside would shift the Assault Differential six
columns in favor of the Defender: two for the Fortification, two for the Rough
Terrain, and two for the Ridge hexside. (This is obviously a good position, one
that should be assaulted only after being softened up by Barrage and Air
Bombardment).

[#15_36]*[15.36]* Assaults down slopes or down escarpments benefit the attacker.
(See Case <<8_37>>, Terrain Effects Chart). If a unit is being attacked through
both an up slope and a down slope hexside (this is quite possible in some areas
of the game-map), the benefit to the attacker is offset by the benefit to the
defender. Thus a unit defending in a hex that is assaulted through a down slope
hex (+1) and an up-Escarpment hex (~3) would have an adjustment of —2 (~3 +1 =
~2) in favor of the defender.

[#15_4]
=== COMBINED ARMS EFFECT ON ASSAULT

The term "Combined Arms”? is used to describe the mutual support of tanks and
infantry. Tanks (and tanks only — not recce or self-propelled artillery, etc.)
must be supported by an equal number of infantry to be completely effective.
Thus, for each TOE Strength Point of tanks engaging in Close Assault, there must
be an equal number of TOE Strength Point of infantry, machinegun, or heavy
weapons units engaging in that Close Assault from the same hex. For every one to
three TOE Strength Points of unsupported tanks, the Actual Close Assault
Strength of the tanks is reduced by one, Thus, if two TOE Points of tanks, each
with a Close Assault rating of 7 are assaulting unsupported, the Actual Close
Assault Strength is reduced to zero. If there were four unsupported tank TOE
Strength Points, their Actual Close Assault Strength would be reduced to two.
In no case may the reduction be more than four Actual Assault Points. This
applies both offensively and defensively.

[#15_5]
=== EFFECT OF ASSAULTING FORCE ORGANIZATIONAL SIZE ON CLOSE ASSAULT

Regardless of the Basic Assault Differential, the organizational size
(battalion, division, etc.) has an effect on the relative strength in an
assault. The greater disparity between the two opposing forces in terms of size
of organization, the greater the benefit (in terms of a Column Shift on the
Assault Differential Combat Results Table) to the larger unit. This is another
rule that reflects the effects of organization and combined arms.

[#15_51]*[15.51]* If, regardless of the Basic Close Assault Differential, one
side has at least twice the number of Raw Close Assault Strength Points as the
other, the superior side adjusts the Assault Differential on the Combat Results
Table two columns (not numbers) in its favor.

Example: 24 Raw Close Assault Strength Points (2 Actual) assaults 12 Raw Close
Assault Strength Points (or 1 Actual}. Normally, the differential (not taking
into account any other effects) would be +1. However, because the attacker has
twice the Raw strength of the defender, he would assault on the +3 Column. This
adjustment always applies, regardless of any other adjustment to the
differential (exception: Case <<15_54>>).

[#15_52]*[15.52]* If the /argest (regardless of number of units involved) unit
in terms of organization of one side in an assault is bigger than the largest
unit organization on the other side there will be a column shift benefitting the
side with the larger unit.  Unit equivalents apply here (see Case <<9_2>>).

[#15_53]*[15.53]* The column adjustments for Organizational Size Difference,
always in favor of the larger unit size, are as follows:

Largest Unit On:

Larger Side Smaller Side Adjustment
Division 3-point 1

Brigade
Division 2-point 2

Brigade
Division Battalion 4
Division Company 8
Any Brigade _ Battalion 2
Any Brigade Company 4
Battalion Company 2

All of the above are equivalents (<<9_2>>).

[#15_54]*[15.54]* There are certain combat units that have no Defensive Close
Assault Ratings (e.g., Commonwealth <<5_5>>” howitzers, German 210mm Howitzers).
If such a unit is alone in a hex and is Close Assaulted by an Enemy unit, such
zero-rated unit is considered to have a Defensive Close Assault Rating of zero.
In addition, two other adjustments are made: (1) The attacking unit takes no
casualties; and (2) there is a three-column adjustment in favor of the Attacker,
in addition to any adjustments for <<15_53>>. Case <<15_51>> does not apply to
this situation.

[#15_55]*[15.55]* For the purposes of this case a brigade is attached to a
division only if the brigade HQ unit (counter) is attached to the division. For
example, a Commonwealth infantry division with nine infantry battalions and no
infantry brigade headquarters attached is a shell in Close Assault. Note that
the two Italian infantry brigade counters (ID Code "m") represent the entire
brigade.

[#15_6]
=== EFFECTS OF MORALE ON CLOSE ASSAULT

The Morale of each side involved in a given Close Assault will affect the Close
Assault Differential.  A complete discussion of Morale is to be found in Section
<<17_0>>.

[#15_61]*[15.61]* Players first determine their individual Adjusted Morale
Rating for that assault (Case 17.2). The Phasing/Assaulting Player then
subtracts the Adjusted Morale Rating of the nonPhasing/ Defending units from
that of the Phasing units. This Final Adjusted Morale number is the number by
which the Assault Differential Column will be adjusted. (See Case <<15_64>>).

[#15_62]*[15.62]* A positive (+) Final Adjusted Morale Rating adjusts the
Assault Differential that number of columns to the right (in favor of the
Phasing Player/Attacker). A negative (—) Final Adjusted Morale Rating adjusts
the Assault Differential that number of columns to the left (in favor of the
non-Phasing/ Defending Player).

[#15_63]*[15.63]* Players should use the "largest unit”' rule, as espoused in
Case <<6_27>>, to determine Morale Ratings for units with different Morale in
the same assault.

[#15_64]*[15.64]* Following is an extended example of how Morale would affect a
given Close Assault:

a. The 15th Panzer Division (Morale of +3) and the Ariete Division (Morale of
+1) are.Close Assaulting the

b. 2nd New Zealand Division (Morale of +1) with the Ist RNF battalion (Morale of
+2) attached.

c. The Axis Divisions both have a Cohesion Level of, say, —4, which will be used
to adjust their combined Morale Rating of +2 (both are divisions, so their
Morale is combined and divided by the number of divisions, +3 +1 + 2 = 2), The
Axis Player now uses his Cohesion Level to adjust his Morale Rating (see Case
<<17_2>>). Consulting the Morale Modification Table (17.4), he rolls a 43 at —4
Cohesion Level, obtaining a — 2 adjustment to his Morale. Axis Adjusted Morale
is now zero (+2 —2=0).

d. The Commonwealth Morale for the assault depends on that of the 2 NZ Division,
as that is the largest unit. The 2NZ has a + 1 Morale and, say, a Cohesion Level
of +2. The Commonwealth Player rolls a 63 on the Morale Modification Table, so
there is no adjustment to the Morale Rating of +1.

e. As the Axis Morale is zero and the Commonwealth Morale is +2, the Final
Adjusted Morale Rating is —\ (Attacker minus Defender). Therefore, any assault
will be modified (by Morale) one column in favor of the defender.

[#15_7]
=== HOW TO USE THE CLOSE ASSAULT COMBAT RESULTS TABLE

[#15_71]*[15.71]* The Close Assault Combat Results Table is a massive Combat
Results Table that uses, for each Player, the roll of two dice added three
different ways to determine a great number of results.  It is important to
remember that each Player throws the two dice only once per assault, with one
minor exception (Case <<15_73>>d). Players should consult the Assault Combat
Results Table and become familiar with it before playing.

[#15_72]*[15.72]* The columns of the Assault Combat Results Table are the
Assault Differentials (see Cases <<15_26>> and <<15_27>>). The rows are
percentage of losses possible. The numbers in the center of the Combat Results
Table are the range of numbers needed to produce the losses (in the rows) under
a particular differential (the column). There are additional results at the
bottoms of each column: Engaged, Retreat (Defender only), and Captured
Possibilities. These are determined from the same diceroll as determines the
losses.

[#15_73]*[15.73]* The Close Assault Combat Results Table uses two dice thrown
once for each Player to determine all results as follows:

a. To determine his losses, each Player consults the Differential on Ais portion
of the Combat Results Table (Attacker or Defender), He then throws two dice,
reading the result sequentially, the larger die first. Thus a 2 on the large die
anda 5 on the small die would be a 25. The Player would look under the
Differential column to find where the 25 would fall, then look to his left to
find his percentage of losses. Example: The Attacker is assaulting at +3. He
throws a 34 to find his percentage of loss. Looking under the +3 Differential
Column in the Attacker's portion of the Combat Results Table, we see that 34
falls in the 5% loss row. The Attacker would suffer losses of 5% (see Case
<<15_8>>).

b. The same diceroll used in (a) is now used to determine Engaged or Retreat
results. However, here the dice are added together (3 + 4 = 7).  Engaged results
are always found on the Attacker's portion of the Combat Results Table; Retreats
on the Defender's portion. Thus in the above example, the same 3 and 4 would now
be aaded to produce a 7. As Engaged results (see Case 15.8) occur only on throws
of 8, 9, 10 or 12 at that Differential, the units are not Engaged. However, if
that 3 and 4 were the Defender's dice roll, the Defender would have to Retreat
one hex (or lose an additional 10%) as one-hex Retreats occur on 4,5, 6, and 7
at that Differential.

c. Using the same procedure as in (b) above, adding the dice together, each
Player checks (with his individual diceroll) to see if any of his percentage
losses have been Captured. Still using the +3 column, there are no Attacking
unit Captured possible in the column, but there are in the +3 Defender Column.
However, the 7 would not result ina Defender Captured, as a diceroll of 2 or 3
is needed to produce Captured units.

d. If a Captured does result, this means that a percentage of the losses is
captured. Thus if the Defending Player in the example we are using threw a 1 and
a2 (12), he would suffer 20% losses, some of which would be Captured (the "3" of
1 + 2 = 3). When a Captured results, the Player throws one more die and consults
the Prisoners Captured Results Table (15.89). In this case, if the Defender
threw a 4, 50% of all his losses rounded up (the 20% of his force) would have
been Captured by the Attacker.

[#15_74]*[15.74]* If, for some reason, botha Retreat and an Engaged result
occurs in the same Close Assault, the Retreat takes priority, and the Engaged
result is ignored.

[#15_75]*[15.75]* The Attacker and the Defender each roll two dice to determine
their results. Both Players use the same Differential column, but they each use
their own section of the Combat Results Table.

[#15_76]*[15.76]* If the diceroll produces a zero loss result, Engaged or
Retreat results may still occur.

[#15_77]*[15.77]* The +11 to +17 et seq columns of the Assault Combat Results
Table comprise the Overrun section of the Combat Results Table. Overrun is not a
voluntary action (as in most games). Overrun in CNA indicates that the Attacker
has amassed such overwhelming strength that he has broken through the defensive
line of the Defender, wreaking comparable losses and enabling him to reach and
possibly destroy many of the defender's guns (see Cases <<15_84>> and
<<15_86>>). In addition, when Overrun, all Defender losses are rounded up.

[#15_78]*[15.78]* The Assault Combat Results Table is a large and seemingly
unwieldy Table. However, it is not difficult to work with, and once the Players
understand the mechanics of the different dicerolls and the method of
determining losses, they will find that the Assault Combat Results Table
produces an unusually wide variety of results.

[#15_79]*[15.79]* Close Assault Combat Results Table

(see Charts and Tables)

[#15_8]
=== DETERMINING CASUALTIES

Eng

[#15_81]*[15.81]* An Engaged result means that all units involved in that
assault are locked in combat. There are extended Capability Point penalties for
an Engaged unit leaving an Enemy ZOC (see Case 8.6). Players should place an
Engaged marker on all units affected to indicate their status. Engaged markers
are removed at the end of the Operations Stage. (Players should note that all
units that had assault and are still adjacent are in Contact, if they are not
Engaged.)

[#15_82]*[15.82]* A Retreat of a specific number of hexes means that the
affected units (including any units in that hex withheld from combat for any
reason, such as Pinned or out of ammo) must move a minimum of that number of
hexes away from the Enemy unit inflicting the Retreat. They must end the Retreat
at least that number of hexes away and should follow the path of least
resistance in the direction of their nearest Supply Dump or City.  For each hex
of mandated Retreat that units cannot or chooses not to Retreat those units
suffer an additional 10% loss. Retreats cost Capability Points. Units in major
cities (or retreated into a major city) may ignore retreat results (or the rest
of any retreat result).

[#15_83]*[15.83]* Percentage Losses are determined in the following manner:

a. The Player affected determines the percentage loss from the Assault Combat
Results Table then

b. Totals all Raw Combat Assault strength Points involved in the assault. The
Defending/nonPhasing Player would add to. this total the Raw Assault Strength
Points of any Pinned or previously retreated units in the hex. In an Overrun,
a/l Defensive units withheld for any reason are added in.

c. Multiply the percentage of loss times the Total Raw Strength Points. The
Attacker rounds up to the nearest whole number, while the Defender rounds down
(but see Case <<15_77>>). Thus a <<35_1>> would be 36 points for the Attacker
but 35 for the Defender. In an overrun, <<1_1>> Defender Points would equal 2.
Defenders should remember to add in any loss percentage they must take for hexes
not retreated (see Case <<15_82>>).

d. The affected Player must now remove enough TOE Strength Points to absorb the
Raw Points lost. Thus one TOE Strength Point of 2 Defensive Close Assault
Ratings infantry would absorb two Raw Points. Remember that some units have
different Close Assault Ratings for Attack and Defense, and that the Attacking
Player uses Offensive Close Assault Points, etc. (See Case <<15_84>>).  Only
those units participating in the assault or, for the Defender, that were pinned
or withheld may be used to absorb losses of Raw Points.

e. All losses must be applied to units in different hexes (if units in more than
one hex are attacked or involved in an attack) proportionally. Example: If 50%
of the Raw Strength Points used by the Phasing Player in a Close Assault are in
one hex and 50% are in a second hex, any losses would be divided evenly between
both hexes.

[#15_84]*[15.84]* Guns (i.e., Artillery, Anti-Tank units, etc.) take losses in
Close Assault under the following circumstances:

a. If the Defending units are Overrun all defending guns, whether Forward or
Back, add their Defensive Close Assault Points (if any) to the total for
determination of percentage lost. Such units may be used to absorb losses as in
Case <<15_83>>.

b. Guns that are Forward are subject to losses, based on their Vulnerability
Rating. The affected Player must remove at least 50% as many Vulnerability
Points of Forward Guns as he has lost Raw Strength Points in that Assault, with
the provision that if at least one Raw Close Assault Point is lost then at least
one Vulnerability Point must be removed (see Case <<14_42>>; Vulnerability uses
the same mechanics as Armor Protection). AA/Flak units are not affected by this
rule.

c. In addition to (a), if there is an Overrun situation, all defending guns are
subject to Vulnerability losses, as in (b). Vulnerability losses are taken after
percentage losses (a).

[#15_85]*[15.85]* If, as a result of an Assault, a Player has some of his TOE
Strength Points Captured (see Case <<15_73>>) he takes that percentage of his
losses as determined in Cases <<15_83>> and <<15_84>> and converts them to
prisoners or captured equipment, which are then turned over to the Enemy Player.
Captured percentages are always rounded upwards.

[#15_86]*[15.86]* Determine Captured TOE Strength Points as follows:

a. First determine what TOE Strength Points (and concurrently what units) have
been eliminated by combat; then

b. Take the Captured percentage of those TOE Strength Points (a);

c. Playerse may use any type of TOE Strength Points to satisfy the Captured
percentage, remembering that the percentage is taken of Raw Assault Points
(either Offensive or Defensive, depending on the situation), not TOE Strength
Points (see Case <<15_83>> for the mechanics of taking losses).

d. Captured infantry-type becomes Prisoner Points, one Prisoner Point for each
TOE Strength Point. Captured Guns and/or Tanks may be taken and used by the
Enemy as they see fit (see <<28_0>>, on Prisoners).

[#15_87]*[15.87]* If any Player's losses amount to 30% or more of the TOE
Strength Points committed to that assault (whether such losses came from
committed units or not), all of that Player's units involved gain three
Disorganization Points. It is faintly possible that both Players could be so
affected, and this is allowed.

[#15_88]*[15.88]* A Player may always voluntarily Surrender his units, rather
than have them slaughtered. Furthermore, units. out of Ammunition or with a —17
or worse Cohesion Level that are assaulted automatically Surrender (see also
Case <<17_25>>).

[#15_89]*[15.89] Prisoners Captured Results Tables*

(See Charts and Tables)

[#15_9]
=== PROBES

[#15_91]*[15.91]* A Probe is any Close Assault conducted (by the Phasing Player)
with less than 50% of his available TOE Strength Points participating in that —
or another — attack (see Case <<10_31>> and <<15_25>>).

[#15_92]*[15.92]* A Probe may be conducted with any number of units, within the
restrictions of Case 15.91.

[#15_93]*[15.93]* All combat results are the same for both sides, with the
exception that all Engaged results are ignored, and the units in the Probe —
both offense and defense — are notin Contact.

[#15_94]*[15.94]* The "Probing" Player does not have to announce that his
assault is a Probe until after the assault is over. Remember, all units are
assigned to Close Assault prior to Anti-Armor Combat.

[#15_95]*[15.95]* Ifal/ Probing units are Recce-type units, any losses from
Close Assault to the Probing units are reduced by 10%.

[#15_96]*[15.96]* If, in a Probe, the Final Adjusted Differential is worse than
-3, the units defending against the Probe do not use any Capability Points to
defend against such Probe.

====
*AN EXAMPLE OF COMBAT*

The following is an extended example of a hypothetical combat. It should clarify
much of the preceding sections, which rules, until actually applied, may seem
somewhat convoluted and mystical.

The Commonwealth Player, in Hex "A", has an Armored Brigade Group containing one
battalion of Stuarts (TOE Strength of 8), one battalion of Crusader II's (TOE
Strength of 7), one motorized infantry battalion (TOE Strength of 5), an
AntiTank Regiment of 2-pounders (TOE Strength of 6), and a regiment of
25-pounder Artillery (TOE Strength of 6). The brigade has a Basic Morale of +1
anda Cohesion Level of — 3. The terrain in the hex is Rough.

The Axis Player has two forces, one in Hex "B”' and one in Hex ‘“‘C", In Hex "B"
is a Kampfgruppe (Brigade) consisting of a battalion of 8 TOE Points of PzIII
Specials (Tanks), two battalions of infantry (each with TOE Strength of 7), and
a regiment of 105mm Guns (TOE Strength of 6). In the adjacent hex ("C") is a
small force consisting of one infantry battalion (TOE Strength of 7) and a
battery of 105mm Guns (TOE Strength of 4). The Axis Basic Morale is +2, with a
Cohesion Level of —2. The Axis Player's units are all German, and he is the
Phasing Player. He attacks.  (Note that the given Cohesion Levels include the
Capability Points expended for the at tack/defense.) The Axis Player, wishing to
get full use from his two Artillery units, places both of them in Forward
position. The Commonwealth Player, having enough Anti-Tank strength with his two
tank battalions and anti-tank regiment, decides not to use his 25-pounders in an
Anti-Tank role and places them Back, for protection. Both Players now choose
their targets for Barrage. The Axis Player, noting the Commonwealth anti-tank
strength (he knows there are two tank battalions and two gun units) decides to
direct his full Barrage against one of the Tank Battalions. He thus totals his
Barrage Points which can be combined because his Guns are Forward, (ten 105's —
Barrage Rating 9 — at a TOE Strength of 10 = 90 Raw Barrage Points) and finds he
has 9 Actual Barrage Points. The Commonwealth Player, with six 25-pounders
(Barrage Rating of 8) will use all 5 Actual Barrage Points (6 x 8 = 48, or 5)
against one battalion of infantry (as he fears the Assault more than the
Anti-Armor fire — a guess, really, as to the Axis intentions — and the Infantry
unit is an easier target). Both Barrage simultaneously, adjusting for terrain
(the Axis units are all in Clear Terrain.)

The Axis Player Barrages, using the "7,8" column on the Barrage Table (adjusting
from "9,10”' because of the Rough Terrain). He needs a roll of 36 or lower to
pin the Tank battalion and he throws a 25. The result is that his target, which
turns out to be the battalion of Stuarts, is Pinned and may not participate in
any further combat.  The Axis Player throws again rolling a "6". This results in
two Truck Points destroyed although the infantry they are transporting is
unharmed. The Commonwealth Barrage, on the "5,6”' row results in No Effect when
the Commonwealth Player rolls a 61. Note that no defending trucks are present so
no second roll is necessary. Both Players now deduct any Ammunition expended.

The Commonwealth Player decides not to Retreat Before Assault with any of his
units, and the Players now assign their units to either AntiArmor or Close
Assault (or nothing). The Axis Player assigns five points (of his 8 available)
of his PzIII Specials to Anti-Armor and all three of his infantry battalions to
Close Assault. He does not use his Artillery for Assault as he wishes to save
ammunition. The Commonwealth Player -assigns his Infantry battalion to Defend
against the Assault and puts his Crusaders into that Assault.  His Stuarts are
pinned and cannot participate, but he does use his Anti-Tank guns for Anti-Armor
Fire. His artillery is Back and may not participate in either Anti-Armor or
Close Assault.

The Axis Player has 3 Anti-Armor Points (5 TOE Points of PzI[ISpec. with an
Anti-Tank rating of 5 x 6 = 30, or 3 Actual). The Commonwealth Player has only 2
(his 6 TOE Points of 2-pounder Anti-Tank, rating of 4 = 24, or 2 Actual). If his
Stuarts had not been Pinned, they could have aided his Anti-Armor effort. Both
Players now fire simultaneously. The Axis Player rolls a 51, and the, result on
the Anti-Armor CRT is a "4". This means that the Commonwealth Player must remove
enough Crusader TOE Points to absorb 4 Armor Protection Points. (He cannot use
his Stuarts as they have been pinned and do not enter into Anti-Armor loss
calculation). As Crusader II's have an Armor Protection Rating of 3, he must
remove 2 TOE Points of Crusaders to absorb the loss. Likewise, the Commonwealth
Player fire Anti-Armor, rolls a 55, resulting in a 3. Each Pzlill Special has an
Armor Rating of 4, so the Axis Player removes 1 TOE of PzIII Specials (taking
them from those tanks assigned to Anti-Armor, rather than upset his Assault
power.)

Both Players now determine their Assault Differentials. The Attacking Axis has
42 Raw Points from Infantry (7 x 2 x 3 = 42) and 21 Raw from his tanks (7 x 3 =
21) for a total of 63 Raw Points, or 6 Actual. As he has 21 Infantry TOE Points
and only 3 Tank TOE Points, he has no problems with Combined Arms effects on
Assault.  The Commonwealth Player has 10 Raw Infantry Points (5 x 2 = 10) plus
28 from his Crusaders (7 x 4 = 28) for a total of 38, for a 4 Actual.  However,
as he has two more Tank TOE Points than Infantry (7 to 5), he subtracts 1 Actual
Point for Combined Arms Effects. The Basic Differential is thus 6 to 3, or +3
for the Axis.

Each Player now checks for his actual Morale at time of Assault. The Axis Player
has a +2 Basic Morale with a Cohesion Level of -2; he consults the Morale
Modification Table, throws a 21, and gets a No Change to his Basic Morale. So
his Adjusted Morale is +2. The Commonwealth Player has a Basic Morale of + !
with a Cohesion Level of -3, Using his -3 Cohesion he also consults the Morale
Modifier Table, throwing a 53. This results in a modification to his Morale of ~
2, for an Adjusted Morale of —1. Comparing his Morale to that of the Axis Player
shows a Finalf Adjusted Morale of +3 (+2 — [~1] = +3). This +3 means that the
Axis Player will adjust the Assault Differential Column three in his favor.
However, the Commonwealth units are in Rough Terrain, which is a two-column
adjustment in their behalf, so the final column adjustment is +1 for the Axis.
(There is no question of a unit Size/Organizational Difference here.) Thus, with
a Basic Differential of +3, and a one-column adjustment for the Axis, the
assault takes place on the +4 Column.

Each Player now throws two dice and consults his portions of the Assault Combat
Results Table to determine his losses. The Axis Player throws a 32.  That means
he loses 5% of his Assaulting Force, and there are no other results for him
(i.e., he is not Engaged). The Commonwealth Player throws a 21. He has several
results from this: (1) He loses 15%; (2) He has 33% of these Captured (an
additional die roll of 4); and he must Retreat all his units at least one hex
(or take an additional 10% loss, which would further affect the Captureds).

The Axis Player Assaulted with 63 Raw Points, which he multiplies by his 5% Loss
to get 3.15, or 4 Raw Points (the Attacker always rounds upwards). He removes
two Infantry TOE Points (onefrom each of two battalions) to absorb the 4 Raw
Points (each of his Infantry has an Assault Offensive Rating of 2, so 2 TOE of
these equals 4 Raw Points). In addition, the Axis Player has his Artillery
forward, so he must remove 50% of his Raw Points Lost in terms of Vulnerability
Points.  This means he has lost 2 Points (Vulnerability) of Artillery. As each
105mm Gun has a Vulnerability of 9, he would have to remove one of his Guns to
absorb the 2 point loss. The Axis Player's losses are thus 2 TOE Points of
Infantry (or about 200-300 men), 5 Panzers (1 TOE), and 1 TOE of 105mm guns (or
4 guns, for this type of gun).

The Commonwealth Player now determines his losses. He used 38 Raw Points; but he
also has Pinned Stuarts, which must be included in the total.  There are 8 TOE
of these, with a Defensive Assault Rating of 4, for a total of 32 Raw, for a
Grand Total of 70 Raw Assault Points. His losses are 15%, or 10.5 Raw Points,
rounded down to 10. Of these, 33% are captured, or, rounding upwards, 4 Raw
Points Captured. The Commonwealth Player has 2 Infantry TOE Points Captured (to
absorb the 4), and eliminates | TOE of Stuart Tanks (4 Raw) and 1 more Infantry
Point (2 Raw) to satisfy the 10 Points lost. He then Retreats his entire Force
one hex, rather than incur additional losses.  He has had about 150 men killed,
about 300 men captured, and lost 5 Stuart and 10 Crusader Tanks. He has also
lost his position.

The Commonwealth suffers no additional losses to his Cohesion Level, aside from
those earned in moving the one hex (to Retreat), However, the Axis Player earns
three Reorganization Points for pushing the Commonwealth Player out of the hex.

[#16_0]
== PATROLS AND RECONNAISSANCE

GENERAL RULE:

Patrols may be conducted in order to determine the identification and strength
of opposing units.  In any Operations Stage in which no Anti-Armor or Close
Assault combat has taken place a Phasing Player may "pull" men out of certain
types of units to patrol in the Patrol Segment. To patrol, the Phasing Player
announces how many Patrol Points are Reconnoitering a given hex. He consults the
Patrol Survival Table, takes losses, if any, then refers to the Reconnaissance
Table to see how effective his patrol has been. Depending on his success on the
Reconnaissance Table, the nonPhasing Player must tell him information about a
given number of units. No units actually move during patrol; patrolling is
handled abstractly.

PROCEDURE:

To patrol, the Phasing Player announces the number of Patrol Points he wishes to
allocate to a given patrol, expends the necessary fuel and ammunition, and
states which hex is being patrolled.  He consults the Patrol Survival Table
(<<16_6>>) and rolls one die to determine any Patrol casualties (unless no combat
units are present in the hex; see Case <<16_32>>). If Patrol Points remain (that is,
if the patrol is not wiped out), the Phasing Player rolls one die and
cross-references the result with the number of remaining Patrol Points on the
Reconnaissance Table (<<16_7>>) to determine what (if any) information his patrol
garners. The non-Phasing Player must now reveal information as required by the
results of the die roll. Finally, the Phasing Player rolls one die and consults
the Objective Loss Table (<<16_8>>) to determine if there are any non-Phasing unit
casualties and, if so, they are extracted.

CASES:
[#16_1]
=== WHICH UNITS MAY PATROL

[#16_11]*[16.11]* Only Recce-type, Light Tank (Italian CV/33's, British Mark VI
Lights, or German Panzer I's), or Motorized Infantry may supply Patrol Points
for Reconnaissance.

[#16_12]*[16.12]* The Phasing Player subtracts — or rather detaches — TOE
Strength Points from the unit/TOE types allowable (Case <<16_11>>) and designates
them as Patrol Points. Example: a Phasing Player detaches two Recce TOE Strength
Points from a Recce battalion in Hex A and assigns them as Patrol Points to
Reconnoiter Enemy-occupied Hex B. The Player notes on his TOE Log sheets the
assignment and any resultant casualties.

[#16_13]*[16.13]* No more than 2 TOE Strength Points may be assigned as Patrol
Points from any one hex, regardless of the number of units in that hex.

[#16_14]*[16.14]* The maximum number of Patrol Points that may be sent to an
Enemy-occupied hex is 3, with Patrol Points from different hexes having the
capability of combining forces for a Reconnaissance operation.

[#16_15]*[16.15]* No unit with a Cohesion Level of -8 or worse may assign TOE
Strength Points to patrol duty.

[#16_16]*[16.16]* For each Patrol! Point sent out on Reconnaissance, the Phasing
Player expends one Am munition Point and 2 Fuel Points. These supplies must be
present in the hex the Patrol Points originate from, and they are expended
regardless of the result of the patrol.

[#16_17]*[16.17]* No Patrols may originate from or be directed into any hex
affected by a Rainstorm or Sandstorm.

[#16_2]
=== RESTRICTIONS ON PATROLLING

[#16_21]*[16.21]* In any Operations Stage that a Phasing Player does not engage
in Anti-Armor Combat or Close Assault against any Enemy units, he may patrol. In
addition, although a Player may patrol if he has used Artillery Barrage during a
given Operations Stage, he may not Reconnoiter any hex which has undergone any
type of Barrage or Air Bombardment. A Phasing Player may launch as many patrols
as he wishes.

[#16_22]*[16.22]* Patrol. Points may reconnoiter any Enemy-occupied hex within
five hexes of the hex the Patrol Points originate from. The five-hex path may
not include any terrain impassable to the units in the patrol (see Case <<16_11>>),
nor may they pass through an Enemy-controlled or occupied hex other than a hex
in the Zone of Control ofthe unit being reconnoitered.

[#16_3]
=== PATROL LOSSES

[#16_31]*[16.31]* Both Players — the Patroller and the Patrollee — must check
for any possible combat losses from Patrol action. However, each Player checks
at a different time.

[#16_32]*[16.32]* The Phasing Player, after assigning his Patrol Points to
Reconnoiter a specific hex, consults the Patrol Survival Table before
reconnoitering, with one exception. The non-Phasing Player must inform him if
there are no combat units in the hex which is being reconnoitered. If there are
no combat units in that hex, the Phasing Player skips the Patrol Survival Table
and suffers no losses.  AA/Flak and Engineer units are not combat units for this
purposes.

[#16_33]*[16.33]* The Phasing Player now rolls one die and consults the Patrol
Survival Table. If ¢// his Patrol Points are from Recce units he subtracts one
from the die roll. Any losses — in TOE Strength/Patrol Points eliminated or
captured by the non-Phasing Player (including trucks) — are deducted immediately
(Phasing Player's choice as to unit type), Captured Points become Prisoner
Points.  Ifno Patrol Points survive, the Phasing Player goes no further; he gets
no information.

[#16_34]*[16.34]* After the Phasing Player has gotten his information, or after
having had all his units eliminated (whichever comes first) the Phasing Player
rolls another die to see whether he has inflicted any losses on the non-Phasing
Player, regardless of the losses he (the Phasing Player) has taken. There is one
exception to this: if the Phasing Player's patrol is eliminated in entirety, the
Captured result on the Objective Loss Table becomes an Eliminated. The choice of
loss (in TOE Strength Points) is up to the non-Phasing Player, but it must come
from a combat unit. If there are no combat units, the non-Phasing Player may
eliminate either Truck Points, AA/Flak Points, Engineer Points, or HQ Points, in
that order of priority.

[#16_4]
=== DUMMY TANK FORMATIONS

Dummy Tank Formations consisted of mock-ups of Tanks, usually made from wood or
canvas covered cars (the Germans used Volkswagons), designed to fool Enemy
intelligence into thinking there were Tank Brigades in places where they
weren't.

[#16_41]*[16.41]* Each Player may use Dummy Tank Formations. These are the
equivalent of Tank battalions in size, but they are worth nothing in combat.
Their CPA is zero.

[#16_42]*[16.42]* To bring a Dummy Tank battalion into play, a Player must
expend 10 Stores, which must be present in the hex in which the Dummy is
“placed". Dummy Tank battalions are placed in the Construction Segment. There
are no actual counters for Dummy Tanks.

[#16_43]*[16.43]* No Player may ever have more than three Dummies in existence
at any one time. No more than one Dummy may be in any one hex. No Italian
formations may ever make use of Dummies, even when mixed with German formations.

[#16_44]*[16.44]* Dummy Tank battalions may be assigned identifications actually
used by other Tank battalions in play. Example: The Commonwealth Player may say
Dummy Tank Battalion #1 is the 4th Royal Tank Regiment, even though the 4 RTR is
in play elsewhere on the game-map.

[#16_45]*[16.45]* Dummies really have only one function: to confuse Enemy
intelligence. Thus they are worthless alone in a hex. Whenever a Player conducts
Reconnaissance against an Enemy hex, the Enemy Player, if he has a Dummy Tank
unit in that hex, may tell him that he has the "X" Tank battalion of any TOE
Strength desired, when revealing information. The patrolling Player has no way
of knowing that this is a dummy or not (until he attacks).

[#16_46]*[16.46]* If a formation with a Dummy Tank battalion undergoes any type
of Close Assault, the Dummy Tank Battalion is eliminated. If a formation
undergoes Anti-Armor fire and has no armor — or loses all its armor — the Dummy
Tank Battalion is eliminated. Anti-Armor fire committed against Dummy Tanks may
not be switched to Assault if the only "armor" is Dummy Tanks!

[#16_47]*[16.47]* For the historians, The Household Cavalry Regiment, a
Commonwealth Armored Car unit, was assigned to North Africa. However, it does
not appear in the OA Sheets as it saw minimal action and was assigned mainly to
handling the task of fitting out and overseeing the Commonwealth Dummy Tank
Formations.

[#16_5]
=== RESULTS OF PATROLS

The Reconnaissance Table (16.7) results are expressed in terms of the number of
battalion-size units about which the non-Phasing Player must reveal information.
Thus, if the Phasing Player has two Patrol Points and obtains a die roll of 4,
he will be told about two of the Enemy's units.

[#16_51]*[16.51]* The non-Phasing Player must reveal the following information
about units: historical designation (e.g., 1/8 Panzer Battalion), type of unit
(mechanized infantry, armored cars, etc.), whether the unit is motorized or not,
and the exact TOE Strength within two of the actual strength at the time of the
Patrol.

[#16_52]*[16.52]* The non-Phasing Player may choose the units in a hex about
which he will reveal the information listed in Case <<16_51>>, if more of his units
are in.the hex than he is required to give information about (exceptions: see
Case <<16_53>>, <<16_54>>, and <<16_55>>).

[#16_53]*[16.53]* Information must be revealed about battalion-sized units,
unless only smaller (or larger) units are present.

[#16_54]*[16.54]* Information may not be revealed about HQ units or AA/Flak
units unless there are no combat units in the hex. Information may be revealed
about Engineer units.

[#16_55]*[16.55]* The Phasing Player may specifically list units about which he
does not wish to receive in formation, and the non-Phasing Player may not choose
such units to satisfy the requirements of Case <<16_5>>. (Presumably, such units
would be ones that the Phasing Player already had adequate information about,
because of previous patrols or combats.)

[#17_0]
== MORALE

GENERAL RULE:

The Morale Rule in CNA attempts to quantify a facet of combat that is so.
subjective that it virtually defies all such attempts. The result: subjective
opinion plays an important part in what is otherwise a highly objective game. In
any case, the Morale rules combine the elements of a Basic Morale Rating
(representing initial training, fitness, enthusiasm, secondary command
capability, etc.), which is a fixed number (with one exception; see Case
<<17_3>>), with the effects of constant campaigning and victory or defeat. The
Cohesion Level of a unit is used to raise or lower the Morale Rating of a unit
at the instant of Close Assault.  This adjusted Morale Rating is then compared
with that of the opposing Player to adjust the Assault Differential one way or
the other.

CASES:

[#17_1]
=== UNIT BASIC MORALE RATINGS

Each unit in the game has a Basic Morale Rating, listed on its OA Sheet, which,
with the exception of Training (Case <<17_3>>), never changes (although it may
be adjusted by Cohesion for individual assaults). The Morale Ratings run from +3
to —3. The Basic Morale Rating of a battalion (or brigade) is always that of its
assigned Parent Formation, unless the unit has been attached to another force or
has been out onits own.

[#17_2]
=== ADJUSTMENTS TO BASIC MORALE RATINGS

[#17_21]*[17.21]* Every time a unit is involved in a Close Assault (or Probe)
its Basic Morale Rating may be adjusted by its Cohesion Level at the instant of
Assault. The effect of Morale on Assault has been discussed in Case <<15_6>>.

[#17_22]*[17.22]* In order to determine the effect of a unit's Cohesion Level on
its Basic Morale Rating, the Players use the Morale Modification Table
(<<17_4>>).  This is another table that uses a two-dice sequential read out
(11-66), with the diceroll taking up the "center" of the Table. In this case,
the Cohesion Level of the unit is on the left, comprising the rows of the Table,
while the Morale Modifier — the number the Player is rolling for — is on the top
of the Table, comprising the columns. Example: A unit has a Basic Morale Rating
of +1. It goes into an Assault with a Cohesion Level of —4. The Player consults
the Morale Modification Table and throws two dice, getting a 42. Locating the
row for —4 Cohesion, the Player reads across until he finds the column in which
a diceroll of 42 is located. That roll is in the —2 column, so the Morale
Modifier is —2, and the Basic Morale is adjusted by that number (+1 —~2 = —1).
The unit's Adjusted Morale Rating for that Assault is -1.

[#17_23]*[17.23]* The maximum Adjusted Morale Rating a
unit can ever have is +3, and the minimum — 3,
regardless of what mathematical possibilities occur. Thus a unit with a +2 Basic Morale Rating
that earns a + 4 modifier does not get an Adjusted
Rating of +6, but just +3 (exception: see Case
17,28).

[#17_24]*[17.24]* Ail Cohesion Levels of ~— 17 or worse use
the "- 17 et seq'? row. All Cohesion Levels of +8
or higher use the " + 8”' row.

[#17_25]*[17.25]* The farthest column on the right is the Surrender column. If a
combination of Cohesion Level and diceroll places the Modifier in that column,
the affected units immediately Surrender (and become Prisoners, see Section
<<28_0>>; Exception: Case <<17_26>>). If both units, for some strange reason,
get a Surrender Modifier, the Surrenders are ignored, no assault occurs, and
both sides are Engaged.

[#17_26]*[17.26]* If a unit or a Formation with a Basic Morale (individual or
combined) of + 1 or better is involved in a Morale Adjustment computation, such
unit follows the Morale Adjustment Table normally with one exception: it ignores
all Surrenders (treating them as a —4 adjustment).  However, it does not ignore
the "Surrender" it one of the following is in effect:

a. The unit has a Cohesion Level of -11 or worse; or

b. The Enemy unit(s) has af least 3 times the Strength (Enemy Raw Offensive
Assault to Friendly Raw Defensive Strength).

[#17_27]*[17.27]* It is possible that a given Player has units of different
Cohesion Levels in the same assault.  The method of determining the applicable
Cohesion Level is the Largest Unit Rule, discussed in Case <<6_27>>.

[#17_28]*[17.28]* Axis units stacked with General Rommel at the instant of
Assault have their Adjusted Morale Rating further adjusted by +1. Thus a unit
with an Adjusted Morale Rating of 0 that is assaulting under the direct command
of Rommel has an Adjusted Morale Rating of +1.

[#17_3]
=== TRAINING

Several of the Commonwealth units arrived in Egypt ill-prepared to fight a
desert campaign.  Therefore, their Morale Rating on arrival is lower than their
assigned Basic Morale. In order to reach their assigned Basic Morale they must
undergo Training.

To forestall questions on the subject, only Commonwealth units must undergo
training for a variety of reasons. Most German units had already undergone
considerable combat before arriving in Africa, and, although they were no more
desertacclimated than any other forces, this previous experience counted for
much, in the designers' minds. As for the Italians, most of these units had
served in Africa, had seen, combat, or are of too low a designated morale to
bother with training.  Those Commonwealth units designated for Training are
based on unit descriptions and fitness reports in the various sources. .

[#17_31]*[17.32]* Units that are in need of Training have, on their OA Sheets,
two Basic Morale Ratings. The rating in parentheses is the Untrained Rating: the
other Rating is the maximum level of Training and Experience that that unit may
reach, through Training.

[#17_32]*[17.32]* A Commonwealth unit undergoes Training in any one of three
areas: Cairo (any one of the city hexes); Helwan (1430); or Alexandria (any city
hex), or Amiriya, Abougir or Deghelia.

[#17_33]*[17.33]* To undergo Training a unit may not expend any Capability
Points during an Operations Stage. If, for any reason whatsoever, a unit expends
CP's during an Operations Stage, its Training has been interrupted.

[#17_34]*[17.34]* For every six Operations Stages that a unit undergoes
Training, it raises its Untrained Basic Morale Rating one point. (Thus, a —1
would become a 0, a +1 a +2, etc.) It may never exceed its designated Basic
Morale.

[#17_35]*[17.35]* In order for a unit to undergo Training, a combat battalion
which has (or has reached) its designated Basic Morale must be present in the
hex with the Training unit during each Operations Stage of Training. Infantry
divisions or brigades may use an Infantry-type battalion; any unit with tanks
must have a Tank battalion present to train.  Such instruction battalions do not
count against stacking limitations, and such battalions used for instructional
purposes must be at least '4 of their assigned TOE Strength. Each instruction
battalion may train as many units as may be stacked in that hex, ;

[#17_36]*[17.36]* Units are not required to undergo Training; they may enter
combat with their lesser Morale Rating and then be pulled back at a later time
for Training. However, only Training can permanently raise the Basic Morale
Rating, regardless of the amount of combat encountered.

[#17_37]*[17.37]* Commonwealth And Axis (see Case 20.43) Training Areas are
indicated on the game maps.

[#17_4]
=== THE MORALE MODIFICATION

TABLE (see Charts and Tables)

[#17_5]
=== VOLUNTARY SURRENDER OF UNITS

A Player's units may be captured thru lack of combat ability or be forced to
surrender as a result of morale determination during a Close Assault, lack of
ammunition of possessing 26 or more Disorganization Points. A player may
voluntarily Surrender his units under certain conditions.

[#17_51]*[17.51]* A Player may voluntarily surrender units.  The surrendered
units are treated as though they were captured or involuntarily surrendered
(e.i., create prisoners for the infantry and turn the tanks, guns, and aircraft
into replacements).

[#17_52]*[17.52]* In order to voluntarily Surrender the following conditions
must be met:

A. The event is not occuring during Step "b" thru "f" of a Combat Segment.

B. All of the units, Replacement Points, etc. in that hex at that instant are
being surrendered.

C. The surrendering units must be adjacent to an Enemy combat unit and be able
to be moved directly into that unit's hex.

[#17_53]*[17.53]* Units may be surrendered to an Enemy combat unit of any size
or status (except <<17_54>>).

[#17_54]*[17.54]* The enemy unit must accept the surrender, expending 2 CP's to
do so. If the Enemy unit cannot expend 2 CP's the units may not voluntarily
surrender.

[#17_55]*[17.55]* The owning Player may attempt to destroy part of the unit's
material at the instant of voluntary surrender. This may only occur after he has
declared that units in a hex are being voluntarily surrendered. The Player may
not attempt to destroy anything that may not be moved or may only be moved in
his Phasing Truck Convoy or Repair Phase.

[#17_56]*[17.56]* The Player may attempt to destroy any portion of his eligible
material. Two determina tions are made, one for tanks and guns and one for
trucks/Motorization Pointr The Player determines how his attempt at destroying
tanks and guns has fared by rolling one die, subtracting one from the die roll
and then multiplying by 10% (e.g., aroll of 4 results in the destruction of 30%
of all designated tank and gun TOE Strength Points).  Trucks/Motorization Point
destruction is determined in a similar manner except that the modified die roll
is multiplied by 20%. Round fractions down.

=== TRAINING CHART

(see Charts and Tables)

[#18_0]
== RESERVE STATUS

COMMENTARY:

The Reserve Rule was prompted by the unusual Time-in-Space problems encountered
using the Capability Point Allowance System and Continual Movement. It protects
the Defender from having the Phasing Player perform feats of incredible speed
and agility far out of synch with the Laws of Motion, Time, and Inertia while,
at the same time, enabling the Phasing Player to hold back certain units to
exploit holes in the line. In essence, units in Reserve — not moving while the
other units are — are still consuming "time" while they stand. Thus their
capability to move and fight is reduced according to how long they spend in
Reserve.

GENERAL RULE:

Reserve is a status which enables units to circumvent the rule that states a
unit must be within two hexes of an Enemy unit to take advantage of the
Continual Movement Concept. Units are placed in Reserve Status in the Friendly
Reserve Designation Phase. At varying times during the Movement/Combat Phase the
Player has the opportunity to pull a unit out of Reserve and use it, with
varying degrees of restrictions, dependent on the length of stay in Reserve.

CASES: Reserve

[#18_1]
=== WHICH UNITS MAY BE PLACED IN RESERVE

[#18_11]*[18.11]* Any units belonging to the Phasing Player may be placed in
Reserve. The non-Phasing Player may not place units in Reserve.

[#18_12]*[18.12]* Units assigned to Reserve Status must be so designated in the
Reserve Designation Phase of the Operations Stage. Units are so designated by
placing a Reserve I marker on top of them.

[#18_13]*[18.13]* Units still in Reserve during the first Reserve Release
Segment of each Movement/Combat Phase, must either be released or have their
Reserve I marker flipped over to its Reserve ET side.

[#18_14]*[18.14]* Units in Reserve II Status remain in that status until either
they are released in a subsequent Reserve Release Segment of that Operations
Stage or the Operations Stage ends.

[#18_15]*[18.15]* Units may be placed in Reserve only in the Reserve Designation
Phase. No unit may be placed in Reserve during the Movement/Combat Phase.

[#18_2]
=== EFFECTS OF RESERVE STATUS

[#18_21]*[18.21]* There are two states of Reserve: Reserve I and Reserve IT. The
Reserve marker on top of the units indicate their current Reserve Status.

[#18_22]*[18.22]* In a Movement Segment, units in Reserve I status may move one
hex (regardless of Capability Point expenditure) as long as they do not enter an
Enemy-controlled hex. Units in Reserve IT status may never move.

[#18_23]*[18.23]* A unit in Reserve / status may be released from such status in
the Reserve Release Segment in the first Reserve Release Segment in that
Operations Stage; i.e., after other units have been moved once. Such a released
unit may then move and fight in the ensuing Movement and Combat Segments with
the following restrictions:

1. It may not voluntarily exceed its Capability PointAllowance in that
Operations Stage; and

2. lt may engage in only one offensive Close Assault in that Operation State.

[#18_24]*[18.24]* A unit in Reserve IT Status may be released in any Reserve
Release Segment subsequent to the first Reserve Release Segment of a given
Operations Stage. Such a unit may then move and fight with the following
restrictions:

1. It may' not voluntarily exceed one-half its Capability Point Allowance
(rounded down) in that Operations Stage. Thus, a non-motorized infantry unit
emerging from Reserve II Status would have a CPA of ‘5' that Operations Stage,
which it could not voluntarily exceed; and

2. It may engage in only one offensive Close Assault (or Probe), within the
restrictions of (1), above, in that Operation Stage; and

3. If it does voluntarily engage in any Close Assault, Anti-Armor or Barrage
that Operations Stage it automatically earns one Disorganization Point, in
addition to any others it might earn.

[#18_25]*[18.25]* Units released from Reserve may be moved (in the immediately
subsequent Movement Segment only) even if they are not within two hexes of an
Enemy unit, which is an exception to Case <<8_23>>.

[#18_26]*[18.26]* Placing a unit in and releasing it from Reserve Status does
not cost any Capability Points.

[#19_0]
== ORGANIZATION AND REORGANIZATION

COMMENTARY:

As has been discussed previously in a variety of sections, the Organization of
the various units — i.e., which battalions are part of which Brigade, which
Brigades and support units form which Division, etc. — is important to the play
of the game, particularly as pertains to Stacking. The basic Organizational
heirarchy is pyramidical: <<2_3>> battalions form a brigade, and <<2_3>>
brigades forma Division. This Section discusses which units are Assigned to a
Parent Unit and which units may be Attached, how to Attach and Detach units, and
when and how units may be built up to maximum strength,

Important: Players should be aware that this Section is one that could cause
considerable problems unless certain basic tenets are understood. First of all,
this Section is an attempt to formulize Organizational Doctrine; the Players are
being forced to mold and use their armies in much the same way as the commanders
did 30 plus years ago. And if it frustrates the Player not to be able to do
things that are clearly beneficial, imagine how it was to those actually
fighting this campaign.  Furthermore, these Organizational rules are not, and
should not be, considered as strict, rigid proscriptions. Rather, Players will
find them easier to use if they attempt to understand the principles underneath
them, and then use the accompanying charts and tables as guides. The charts and
tables reflect the maximum Attachments and Assignments; anything within those
limits can certainly be accomplished. Most of all, this Section should be played
with attention to the flavor and meaning of the campaign which is being fought.

GENERAL RULE:

Each unit represented by a counter in the game is either independent or assigned
and/or attached to a Parent Formation. Companies, battalions, and brigades may
be assigned and/or attached; division HQ units are always independent.
Divisions, brigades, and battalions may have subsidiary units attached or
assigned to them (i.e., be Parent Formations). Historical assignments are listed
on the Organization at Arrival Chart (O/A Chart, see Case <<4_4>>); within
limits, Players may alter these assignments. Players may more freely alter
attachments. Limitations on such alterations are generally related to the
capacity of the Parent Formation(s) to absorb subsidiary units. The historical
TOE of battle (not the units themselves, but how many of each type there were)
of every potential Parent Formation is listed on the Formation Organization
Chart (19.3). Restrictions on additional attachments are listed for each
Formation on the Maximum Unit Attachment Chart (<<19_5>>).

[#19_1]
=== DIFFERENCE BETWEEN "ASSIGNED" AND "ATTACHED" UNITS

[#19_11]*[19.11]* A unit is assigned to a specific Parent Formation if that unit
is considered a part of that Parent Formations organization (e.g., the 8th
Panzer Regiment — a Brigade equivalent, see <<9_2>> — begins the game assigned
to the 15th Panzer Division).

[#19_12]*[19.12]* A unit is attached to a specific Parent Formation if the
counter representing the Parent Formation on the map represents the attached
unit as well. (i.e., not only are both the attached unit and the Parent
Formation in the same hex, but they are functionally combined into one unit).

[#19_13]*[19.13]* It is possible for the same unit to have two different Parent
Formtaions simultaneously, one to which it is assigned, and one to which it is
attached. A unit may never be attached to more than one Parent Formation at
once; nor may a unit ever be assigned to more than one Parent Formation at once.
Note: A unit must be in the same hex as a Parent Formation to which it is
attached (indeed, it is represented on the game-map by the Parent Formation's
counter); it need not be in the same hex as a Parent Formation to which it is
assigned.  Of course, a particular unit may be both assigned and attached to the
same Parent Formation.

[#419_14]*[419.14]* It is possible for the same unit to be a Parent Formation
and to simultaneously be, in turn, assigned and/or attached to another (higher
level} Parent Formation. Note that the units attached to a particular Parent
Formation may affect whether or not it can be attached in turn to another unit.

Example: If the lst Kings Royal Rifle Corps was detached from the 7th Armored
Division (its assigned Parent Formation) and sent to support the 2nd New Zealand
Division; the Ist KRRC, when absorbed by the 2nd NZ would become attached to one
units and assigned to another.

[#19_2]
=== UNIT ASSIGNMENTS

Each Parent Formation (or potential Parent Formation) has an inherent set of
limitations on the number and/or type of subsidiary units which may be assigned
to it. These limitations are listed on the Formation Organization Chart (<<19_3>>).
Example: An Italian armor Brigade may have assigned to it three armored
battalions.

Units enter the game already assigned to a specific Parent Formation.
Assignments are generally permanent, with excepetions for eliminated units for
historical assignment shifts and assignment pattern shifts, and for British
battalions, as detailed in the following Cases. Any new assignments or
reassignments are accomplished during the Player's

Reorganization Segment and recorded on the appropriate Parent Formation's TOE
Log Sheet.

[#19_21]*[19.21]* Any Parent Formation which has fewer units assigned to it than
its maximum (see Case <<19_3>>) may be assigned additional independent
(non-assigned) units up to that limit (e.g., If only two armored battalions were
attached to an Italian armor brigade, the Axis Player could, in his
Reorganization Segment, assign any independent Italian armored battalion to that
brigade). In order to be assigned to a Parent Formation, an independent unit
must be currently attached to it.

[#19_22]*[19.22]* Should a unit's assigned Parent Formation be eliminated, (see
Case <<19_11>>), if that — presumably detached — unit survives, it is considered
independent and eligible for re-assignment in accordance with Case <<19_21>> and
<<19_3>>.

[#19_23]*[19.23]* Should an assigned unit be eliminated, the assignment is
considered terminated and another independent unit may be assigned to the Parent
Formation in the eliminated unit's place. (i.e., eliminated units do not count
towards the limitations listed in Case <<19_3>>).

[#49_24]*[49.24]* The OA Chart (Case <<4_45>>) contains notes concerning
historical shifts in assignment relationships for several units. Players are
free to either institute or ignore such assignment shifts at their option,
within the restrictions of Case <<19_21>> (see also Case <<19_25>>). Such
re-assignments must be accomplished sometime during the month listed on the OA
Chart note, or not at all.

Example: When the German 15th Panzer Division arrives it contains the <<1_5>>th
Panzergrenadier (motorized infantry) Regiment, albeit in a somewhat reduced
state. At a later date, listed in the notes of the 15th Panzer and S5th/21st
Panzer divisions, that the <<1_5>>th Regiment, originally assigned to the 15th
Panzer, becomes part of the 21st (nee' 5th Light) Panzer Division, taking on
some additional units to flesh out its structure. If the Player wishes to switch
the <<1_5>>th to the 21st Panzer Division, the <<1_5>>th would then be assigned
to the 21st Panzer as per this case.

[#19_25]*[19.25]* As indicated on the Formation Organization Chart (<<19_3>>), the
historical assignment limitations on Commonwealth armored divisions and brigades
changed three times. The Commonwealth Player may, at his option, assign
available independent units to such Parent Formations when these changes allow
additional units to be assigned, The Commonwealth Player must "unassign" excess
units whenever new, limitations require him to doso.

[#19_26]*[19.26]* A special rule applies to Commonwealth Brigades (both Infantry
and Armor). Throughout the war, the Commonwealth made it a practice to shuffle
individual battalions from one "assignment" to another. This was especially
prevalent in the Indian units, where battalions like the <<2_5>> Mahratta Light
Infantry appears virtually everywhere. Therefore, the Commonwealth Player is
permitted to pull assigned battalions from a Brigade and replace them with
others from another Brigade (or from the unassigned group).  Such battalions are
then considered assigned to their new Brigade. Battalions may only be reassigned
or shuffled; they may not simply be "unassigned" and made independent. Example:
The 2nd Armored Brigade (1st Armored Division) may pull the 10th Royal Hussars
and 9th Lancers out, send them to Alexandria for refitting (with, perhaps, new
tanks, etc.) and replace them with the 4th and 7th Royal Tank Regiment. The
latter two units are now assigned to the 2nd Armored Brigade.

[#19_27]*[19.27]* Some units (designated with an asterisk on their counters) are
assigned to Parent Formations that never made it to Africa. Except in accordance
with Case <<19_26>>, such units may not be reassigned.

[#19_28]*[19.28]* Only independent units may be assigned to a Parent Formation.
No unit assigned to one Parent Formation may be assigned to another, except as
noted in Case <<19_26>>.

Remember: Assigned units take up "space" in a Parent Unit's TOE, regadless of
where they are.  Even if not attached, an assigned unit occupies its allotted
space in the Parent Unit's TOE.

[#19_3]
=== FORMATION ORGANIZATION CHART

(see Charts and Tables)

The Formation Organization Chart lists the assignment limitations of "normal"
units of divisional and brigade level. The maximum number of assigned units of
each type that make up the units normal organizational structure are listed. A
number of units have singular organizational structures, as noted on the OA
Chart; such units are limited by those strictures, and not by any listed on the
Formation Organization Chart.

(see Charts and Tables)

(see Charts and Tables)

[#19_4]
=== RESTRICTIONS ON ATTACHMENT AND DETACHMENT

Any units assigned to a particular Parent Formation may freely be attached to or
detached from that Parent Formation. Most Parent Formations may have some number
of additional nonassigned units of certain types, over and above their
assignment limits, attached to them. These attachment limits are listed on the
Maximum Attachments Chart (19.5). Non-assigned units may also be substituted for
"missing" assigned units (Case <<19_45>>),

[#19_41]*[19.41]* A unit assigned but not attached to a Parent Formation may
become attached to that Parent Formation at any time so long as both units are
in the same hex, at.a cost of one Capability Point each to both the subsidiary
unit and the Parent Formation. The counter representing the attached unit is
removed from the map. Note that moving such a unit into the hex with the Parent
Formation (or vice versa) and immediately attaching it would have no effect upon
the Stacking Point value of the Parent Formation (unless if it was a Shell; see
Case <<9_26>>).

[#19_42]*[19.42]* A unit not assigned to a Parent Formation in the same hex may
be attached to that Parent Formation subject to the restrictions of Cases
<<19_4>> and <<19_5>> (if applicable) at a cost of two Capability Points for
both units during the owning Player's Reorganization Segment, only. Note that
the unit would have to be moved into the hex containing the Parent Formation (or
vice versa) during an earlier Movement Segment, subject to all stacking
restrictions.

[#19_43]*[19.43]* A unit assigned and attached to a particular Parent Formation
may be detached from that Parent Formation at any time at a cost of one
Capability Point to both units.

[#19_44]*[19.44]* A unit attached but not assigned to a Parent Formation may be
detached from that Parent Formation only during the owning Player's
Reorganization Segment or Movement Segment at a cost of one Capability Point
each to both units. However, note that units are moved individually or.as a
stack, and once stopped, can be moved no further. Thus, jf a unit is detached
from a Parent Formation during a Movement Segment, movement of either the
detached unit or Parent Formation must cease (unless they are moved on as a
stack).

[#19_45]*[19.45]* A unit(s) may be attached to a Parent Formation that has fewer
units assigned to it than the maximum restrictions listed on the Formation
Organization Chart (19.3) as a substitute for the “‘missing" (that is, not in
the games, or reassigned as per Case <<19_66>>) unit(s). Such a unit must not
exceed, in its own organizational structure, the maximum limits that would apply
to the missing assigned unit it is being substituted for.  Example: If one
infantry brigade assigned to a Commonwealth infantry division were eliminated,
the Commonwealth Player could attach an -independent infantry brigade to that
division as a substitute. He could not, however, attach an infantry brigade to
which more than three infantry battalions were assigned as a substitute, since
that unit would exceed the applicable Formation Organization limits.

[#19_46]*[19.46]* A unit attached to a Parent Formation which is itself in turn
attached to a larger Parent Formation is considered attached to the larger
Parent Formation also. Note: This requirement may render it impossible (unless
detachments are made) to attach a certain unit to a Parent Formation because
other units attached to the first unit cannot be fitted into the Parent
Formation's organizational structure. Exception: Units attached to a Parent
Formation in turn attached to a larger Parent Formation in accordance with Case
19.45 do not count as being attached to the larger Parent Formation.

[#19_47]*[19.47]* Any units currently attached to a Parent Formation may be
detached in such a way that they end up attached to one another at a cost of
only the Capability Points required for detachment.

For example, the <<1_2>>nd Regimente Corazzate and the Nizza Cavelleria Regiment
are detached fromthe Ariete Division. The N.C. Rgt. may be attached to the
<<1_2>>nd R.C. at this point without any additional expenditures.

[#19_5]
=== MAXIMUM ATTACHMENT CHART

(see Charts and Tables)

The limits listed on this chart apply to all units of the indicated size and
type, regardless of whether or not the unit's organization is "standard'”'
(i.e., whether it appears on the Formation Organiztion Chart, <<19_3>>) or not.

[#19_6]
=== REBUILDING DEPLETED UNITS

The method of replacing TOE Strength Points and/or Rebuilding units is covered
in Replacements (Case <<20_4>>). It should be pointed out here, however, that no
unit may ever be rebuilt or augmented to the point that it exceeds its printed
ID Code Maximum TOE Strength. Example: The Italian Light Tank battalionsmay
never have more than nine TOE Strength Points of Tanks.  (Whether these can be
Light and/or Medium is covered in Case <<19_64>>).

There are some cases, albeit rare, where the arriving TOE Strength is below the
"paper" strength of the unit. This fact is usually listed in the TOE & Weapon
System(s) section for that unit, and the Players may increase these units
accordingly.

[#19_61]*[19.61]* Units that have been depleted (reduced) by combat, attrition,
etc., may be augmented by Replacements (see Case <<20_4>>). No unit may ever be
increased above its stated maximum TOE Strength Level (listed in the OA Chart
for that unit).

[#19_62]*[19.62]* Units that have been completely eliminated because of
attrition on combat—not breakdown (i.e., no TOE Strength Points remaining) may
not be rebuilt. However, HQ units that have lost aff their assigned battalions
may have new battalions assigned (up to the number listed on the OA Chart) as
long as the HQ unit exists asa cadre.

[#19_63]*[19.63]* If a HQ unit (counter) is eliminated, it may not be rebuilt
unless at least 50% of its assigned units still exist and are not attached to
other units. In such case, two Infantry Replacement Points may be used to revive
the HQ, Otherwise it is gone for good.

[#19_64]*[19.64]* The use of Replacement Points is covered in Case <<20_4>>.
However, the following principles apply in using Replacement Points to rebuild
units:

a. Infantry Replacement Points may be used to rebuild a wide variety of
Infantry-type units, as well as HQ and Engineer units;

b. Artillery units may be rebuilt with any type of artillery guns. (Commonwealth
Players may want, for historical purposes to limit their Medium Regiments to
their Medium Guns and Field Regiments to their Field Guns, etc., but this is not
arule.) ,

c. Tanks may be assigned to any Tank Battalion/ Regiment. (Historically, the
Commonwealth used a system of I- or Infantry-tanks, Cruiser Tanks, and Light
Tanks. Historians familiar with this might want to follow this system; it is
really unimportant on an Operational Level. The Italians used a similar system
that is easier to discern.)

d. Creation of Heavy Weapons Points requires the expenditure of Infantry
Replacement Points and Gun Replacement Points.

[#19_65]*[19.65]* Armored Recce and Armored Car units use Recce points, usually,
to rebuild. However, the Players may wish to use their Light Tanks to augment
Recce units (see Case <<20_6>>).

[#19_66]*[19.66]* In an instance where a battalion assigned to a Parent
Formation has either been eliminated entirely or has, for any reason, been
assigned to another Formation, the assigned "space" for that battalion may be
taken by another, previously unassigned, battalion. The latter battalion is then
considered assigned to the new Parent, although it was not previously so.
Example: The 42nd RTR of the Ist Army Tank Brigade is destroyed completely. The
Commonwealth Player may assign, say, the 7th RTR to fill its place, even though
the 7th RTR would not normally be allowed to be assigned to the Ist Army Tank
Brigade. (It would be allowed to "switch" under Case <<19_26>>).

[#19_67]*[19.67]* The HQ unit for a Parent Formation is, for play purposes, its
Cadre. As long as the HQ exists, that Parent Formation may be rebuilt by or
Reassignments. If the HQ is eliminated, see Case 19.62 and <<19_63>>.

[#19_68]*[19.68]* Rebuilding units takes place in the Organization Phase only;
it may not take place at any other time. For every two Replacement TOE Strength
Points added to a unit, that unit (and its parent, if such is the situation)
uses one Capability Point. A unit may earn Disorganization Points by taking on a
large number of Replacement Points in an Operations Stage. Severely depleted
units a Player wishes to so refit should be first moved to rear areas.

[#19_7]
=== AXIS BATTLE GROUPS

[#19_71]*[19.71]* The Germans — and to some extent the Italians — have the
ability to form Battle Groups (Kampfgruppen) out of ad hoc units or from units
from other divisions and brigades. The Germans did this quite often, molding
individual Battle Groups to fit an occasion. Therefore, at any time during an
Organization Phase (and only then), the Axis Player may form Battle Groups with
his units. All units must be in the same hex in the Organization Phase, and they
must conform to Stacking Restrictions and the limits listed in the following
Cases. Battle Group counters are pro- | vided to give HQ support. (These Battle
Groups are given historical names, but can be used in any fashion.)

[#19_72]*[19.72]* A German Battle Group can carry a maximum of four battalion
sized units of any type, but there may be no more than one tank battalion and/or
two infantry battalions. Up to two additional companies may be attached over
this limit.

[#19_73]*[19.73]* The Italians also formed Battle Groups, but on a limited
basis. No actual counters are provided, but the Italian Player, if he wishes,
may form Battle Groups using the list of Battle Groups on the Italian OA Sheet.
Italian Battle Groups may have a maximum of three battalion-sized units, only
two of which may be infantry and only one of which may be armor. One
company-sized unit may be attached. No more than two Italian Battle Groups may
be in existence at one time.

[#19_8]
=== FORMING AD HOC AXIS ANTI-TANK BATTERIES

The Axis Player may use his Anti-Tank Gun Replacement Points (his Marders will
be especially useful) to form "ad hoc" units; i.e., new units not in the game.
Essentially, he will be forming batteries of from 3 to 6 TOE Strength Points of
any one AT gun.

[#19_81]*[19.81]* The Axis Player's Brigade-Level HQ units (including
Kampfgruppe) bearing an infantry-type symbol may contain up to six TOE Strength
Points of anti-tank guns.

[#19_82]*[19.82]* The Axis Player may augment any Brigade-Level HQ at any point
in the game with Anti-tank TOE Strength Points if, at that point in time, all of
his anti-tank units on the map (which includes the Tripoli-Tunisia boxes for
this purpose) are ai at least 67% of their maximum permitted TOE Strength.

[#19_83]*[19.83]* The augmentation is performed by assigning anti-tank
Replacement TOE Strength Points to the HQ as if the HQ is an anti-tank unit. The
initial assignment must be at least three TOE Strength Points.

[#19_84]*[19.84]* The assigned Anti-Tank Replacement Points are trained at the
Gun Replacement Point rate.

[#19_85]*[19.85]* An HQ that contains Anti-Tank TOE Strength Points possesses a
CPA equal to that of those Anti-Tank Points.

[#19_86]*[19.86]* The Axis Player may only assign a single type of anti-tank
guns to a particular HQ (if they are eliminated completely he may begin again
with any type of anti-tank gun). Note that captured anti-tank guns cannot be
used to augment.

[#19_87]*[19.87]* An augmented HQ retains a Stacking Point value of zero
regardiess of the number of AT points it currently contains.

[#19_9]
=== AUGMENTING COMMORWEALTH BATTALIONS WITH ANTI-TANK

[#19_91]*[19.91]* Starting with the 75th Game-Turn (April 1, <<19_2>>), the
Commonwealth Player may increase the capabilities of certain of his infantry
battalions by giving them TOE Strength Points of Anti-Tank guns.

[#19_92]*[19.92]* Only those infantry battalions possessing a CPA Rating of 10
(whether or not they were historically motorized; i.e., CPA Rating of 10+) and
Offensive/Defense Close Assault Ratings of either <<1_2>> or <<2_2>> may be so
augmented.

[#19_93]*[19.93]* These infantry unit's characteristics change to now permit the
unit to contain a second weapons system (i.e., Anti-Tank TOE Strength Points).

[#19_94]*[19.94]* Each historically motorized infantry battalion (CPA of 10+)
may contain 2 TOE Strength Points of anti-tank guns. Each historically
nonmotorized infantry battalion (CPA of 10) may contain one TOE Strength Point
of Anti-Tank guns.

[#19_95]*[19.95]* The Anti-Tank Points are assigned to the infantry unit as
regular Gun Replacement Points.  They undergo training at the Gun Replacement
Point rate.

[#19_96]*[19.96]* No Anti-Tank TOE Strength Points may be so assigned if, at
that point in time, any antitank regiment assigned to the infantry battalions
parent unit(s) is not at maximum TOE Strength.

[#19_97]*[19.97]* Once the Anti-Tank Points have been absorbed by the infantry
unit they possess the CPA of that infantry unit (i.e., a CPA of 10 if the
infantry are walking or a CPA of 20 or 25 if the infantry are motorized).

[#19_98]*[19.98]* Anti-Tank TOE Strength Points do not affect any shell
determinations of the infantry unit.

[#20_0]
== REINFORCEMENTS, REPLACEMENTS AND COMMONWEALTH WITHDRAWALS

GENERAL RULE:

Both sides receive Reinforcements and Replacements. Reinforcements are entire
units; Replacements are TOE Strength Points of particular Classes. Both Players
receive Reinforcements according to the schedule listed on the Reinforcement
Track. In addition, the Commonwealth Player receives Replacements according to
Commonwealth Production, and the Axis Player receives Replacements more or less
at his whim out of the Axis Replacement Pool.

Important: Any Replacement die rolls may be kept secret from the other Players
(including other members of your own team).

CASES:

[#20_1]
=== REINFORCEMENTS

[#20_11]*[20.11]* Reinforcements are new, whole units that arrive as specified
by the Reinforcement Track.  Thus, in the September <<3_2>>, Operations Stage,
the Commonwealth Player receives the 6th New Zealand Brigade (and its three
battalions) as well as the 6th NZ Field Artillery Regiment.

[#20_12]*[20.12]* Reinforcements enter the game at the beginning of the Naval
Convoy Arrival Phase of the Operations Stage. There is no Capability Point cost
for debarking; arriving units may be moved in the first Operations Stage of
arrival. (The arrival dates have been adjusted to account for the logistical
problems of debarkation, etc.) Units do not pay a Capability Point cost for the
first hex they are placed in.

[#20_13]*[20.13]* Reinforcements are treated as any other units as soon as they
have arrived, and they may perform any and all game functions normally.

[#20_14]*[20.14]* Commonwealth reinforcements, unless noted below, arrive at
Cairo. Layforce Commando unit (Game-Turn 19) and the Tiger Convoy (Game-Turn 32)
of Tank Replacement Points (which are reinforcements) arrive in Alexandria.
Returning withdrawn units arrive at Cairo or Alexandria at the Commonwealth
Player's option (subject to stacking restrictions).

[#20_15]*[20.15]* Ali Axis reinforcements arrive in Tripoli, However, if there
are no Commonwealth land combat units west of Mersa Matruh (inclusive) then “the
Asis Player may divert forces to Benghazi. The Axis Player may bring in one
battalion-equivalent combat unit or two companyequivalent combat units and up to
ten Truck (or Motorization) Points assigned to arrive with that unit (or its
parent unit). The Axis Player may not divert units to Benghazi if this will
exceed stacking restrictions or if Benghazi has worse than a Level three
efficiency at that point in time. This use of Benghazi does affect its port
capacity for that Operations Stage (see Case <<55_1>>).

[#20_2]
=== REPLACEMENT POINTS

Replacement Points are designated by Class as follows: Infantry Points, Gun
Points, Tank Points, and Recce Points. Replacement Points usually enter the game
for Axis Replacement Points only — at the option of the Axis Player from the
Axis Replacement Points Pool (see Case 20.6),-or — for the Commonwealth Player
only — in accordance with the Commonwealth Production System (see Case
<<20_7>>). All Replacement Points, regardless of the method in which they enter
the game, are covered by the same restrictions as listed in this Case.

[#20_21]*[20.21]* All Replacement Points "arrive" in the Naval Convoy Arrival
Phase of an Operations Stage. Replacement Points mandated by the Reinforcement
Track arrive in a particular Stage of a particular Game-Turn as designated.
Replacement Points from the Axis Replacement Points Pool arrive in a particular
Stage as determined by the Axis Player; however, he must plan such arrivals two
full Game-Turns in advance (see Case <<20_6>>).  Replacement Points from
Commonwealth Production also arrive in particular Stages as determined by the
Commonwealth Player; these must be determined four Game-Turns in advance (see
Case <<20_7>>).

[#20_22]*[20.22]* Commonwealth Replacement Points may be—rarely—listed on the
Reinforcement Track.They are designated by type (e.g., the Commonwealth Player
will receive "27 points of Matildes," not merely "27 points of tanks").

[#20_23]*[20.23]* Replacement Points that are available in the Axis Replacement
Pool are designated by type only. He is limited as to how many points of each
type may be brought in during any one turn. See the Axis Replacement Pool.

[#20_24]*[20.24]* Similarly, Replacement Points available according to the
Commonwealth Production System are designated by type and limited as to
availability.

[#20_3]
=== REPLACEMENT POINT CONVERSION CHART

(see Charts and Tables)

[#20_4]
=== HOW REPLACEMENT POINTS

[#20_41]*[20.41]* Trained Replacement Points may be assigned to (and absorbed
by) a unit any place on the game-map (even in an Enemy Zone of Control).
However, the Replacement Point and the receiving unit must be in the same hex.
This means that "Mohammed usually goes to the Mountain,”' rather than the
latter. Points must be assigned for eventual delivery to specific units
immediately upon arrival. Should the designated unit be eliminated, or
withdrawn, such points must be reassigned immediately.

[#20_42]*[20.42]* Counters are provided to represent the Replacement Points.
Replacement Point counters have all the characteristics of an actual unit, with
several major exceptions:

a. They may never voluntarily enter an Enemy Zone of Control unless the hex is
occupied by a Friendly unit;

b. They may never be used in any type of combat other than defending against
Close Assault, regardless of the strategic or tactical situation;

c. They all have a Basic Morale of — 3 (in their unabsorbed state);

d. They may never exceed their Capability Point Aliowance (which is that of the
unit they are being assigned to); if they ever exceed their CPA — for any reason
— they are considered to have a Cohesion Level of — 26.

[#20_43]*[20.43]* Replacement Points (both Axis and Commonwealth) are required
to undergo Training. They must train for a specific number of Operations Stages,
which may include the Stage of arrival, Players should consult the rules on
Training (17.3) for particulars, as the same rules that apply to Training
Reinforcements apply to Replacements. Axis points train in Tripoli or any major
city. Commonwealth units train in those locations listed in Case <<17_32>>. When
in doubt as to unit size, five Replacement Points equals one battalion. The
schedule for Replacement Training is as follows:

[cols="2,3", options="header"]
|===
| Type of Replacement | OpStages of Training

| Gun Replacement
| One (Actually, not Training; more un-crating)

| Infantry Replacement
| Three

| Tank, AC, Recce Replacement
| Six
|===

*Note*: This has nothing to do with Commonwealth
training for Morale.

[#20_44]*[20.44]* In essence, within the parameters of Case 20.42, Trained
Infantry Replacement Points are usually trucked (if available) to the Front Line
after undergoing Training, where they are transferred to the unit of
assignation. Trained Tank, Gun and Recce Replacement Points may move on their
own, use Railroads (Commonwealth), etc.

[#20_45]*[20.45]* Like other normal units, Replacement Points require Stores and
Fuel (if vehicles) when moving. Remember, five Replacement Points is the
equivalent of a battalion for all purposes. They can be assigned ammunition, but
this is pretty much a waste of supplies, given the maxims of Case <<20_42>>.

[#20_46]*[20.46]* Replacement Points moving toward the Front for purposes of
assignment are considered Truck Convoys and move only in the Truck Convoy
Movement Phase.

[#20_47]*[20.47]* Players should use the Replacement Point Availability and
Assignment Sheets for keeping track of what is happening with their Replacement
Points.

[#20_48]*[20.48]* The cost in Capability Points to attach Replacement Points to
units is listed on the Capability Point Cost Summary (6,3) Replacement Point
units are considered as Assigned units for this purpose.

[#20_49]*[20.49]* Replacement Points may be absorbed only during the-
Reorganization Segment. They then acquire the assigned unit's cohesion,
breakdown and other levels.

[#20_5]
=== UPGRADING ARMORED CAR
EFFECTIVENESS

At the beginning of the campaign, most Armored Car and Reconnaissance (Recce)
units were "light" in nature, using lightly armored cars, carriers, and AP
trucks mostly equipped with antipersonnel weapons. As the war progressed, this
equipment was often upgraded with the addition of light tanks and better-armed
cars and carriers.  This rule reflects that increase in effectiveness.

[#20_51]*[20.51]* All armored reconnaissance and armored car (i.e., Italian ID
Code "ww,”' German ID Code ‘“go”? and Commonwealth ID Code "hh”' thru ““tt??
inclusive) units that arrive/deploy with an Anti-armor Rating of zero (even
those also possessing an Offensive Close Assault Rating of “*3" — see Case
<<20_54>>) may be increased in effectiveness with the following exception. None
of the Commonwealth Player's Recce units assigned to Infantry Divisions (for
this purpose, the 18th Brigade of the 7th Australian Division is. considered a
division) may be upgraded (i.e., the 51st Recce Regiment of the 51st Highland
division could not be upgraded).

[#20_52]*[20.52]* To upgrade an Armored Recce or A/C unit, the Player simply
adds one TOE Strength Point of certain types of tanks (as listed in <<20_53>>)
to the Recce or A/C units, remembering that the unit may never exceed its stated
TOE maximum.  Thus, he may add the TOE to replace a lost TOE Point, or he may
simply add the Tank TOE in and not increase the TOE Strength Points, if the
Recce or A/C unit is already at maximum level.

[#20_53]*[20.53]* Commonwealth Players may use Stuarts to upgrade their Recce/AC
units. German units may be upgraded by adding Pz JJ TOE points.  Italian units
may be upgraded by adding M/11 or L6/40 Tank Points, or armored recce/armored
car Replacement Points.

[#20_54]*[20.54]* An "upgraded" Recce or A/C unit's TOE Strength Point has an
Anti-Armor Rating of 1, instead of zero, and an Offensive Close Assault Rating
of 3, instead of 2.

[#20_55]*[20.55]* No units may be upgraded until1/39, at the earliest.

[#20_6]
=== AXIS PLANNED REPLACEMENTS

Italian and German Replacement Points enter the game from the Axis Replacement
Pool (20.66) asa result of direct planning by the Axis Player.

[#20_61]*[20.61]* In the Axis Replacement Pool, the Axis Player will find the
maximum number of Replacement Points for each type of point for the entire
Campaign Game. (Each Scenario lists the maximum available for that Scenario, if
any). The Axis Player may never use more Replacement Points than are provided.
This is further limited by the maximum points available per turn, per type.

[#20_62]*[20.62]* The Axis Player may bring in any number of Replacement Points
of any and all Classes during any one OpStage (see Case <<20_23>>) limited of
course by the pool restrictions. However, each Replacement Point is counted
against the Shipping Tonnage allowance for that Game-Turn (see Case 51.5). The
equivalent tonnage of each Point is given in the Pool Table. Thus, if the Axis
Player wishes to bring in 10 Italian Infantry Replacement Points, he would need
<<3_0>> Tons of Shipping availability.

[#20_63]*[20.63]* All Axis Replacement Points coming from the Axis Replacement
Pool must be Planned for at least two turns in advance. In other words, Axis
Planned Replacements for July, <<19_1>> must be determined in the Naval Convoy
Arrival Phase of the 1/I1iGame-Turn of June, <<19_1>>. Replacement planned in
June II] may arrive in any OP Stage Navel Convoy Arrival Phase of July I.

[#26_64]*[26.64]* Replacement Points have priority in Shipping Space over any
type of supplies. The Axis Logistics Commander thus has to keep a close watch
(and tight rein) on what he is shipping at what time, as he rarely knows that
far in advance exactly how much shipping he will have available (see Section
<<51_0>>). Remember, Axis Shipping is subject to Commonwealth air Raid, so keep
aneye on Malta and the location of Commonwealth airfields.

[#20_65]*[20.65]* Replacement Points may not be absorbed by units that have no
place for them, so remember to space your Replacements carefully.

(see Charts and Tables)

[#20_7]
=== COMMONWEALTH PRODUCTION

[#20_71]*[20.71]* Most Commonwealth units and some of their Replacements arrive
via the Reinforcement Track. However, most -Replacements — mostly "drafts" and
transport — arrive somewhat randomly as mandated by the Commonwealth Production
Tables (20.78).

[#20_72]*[20.72]* The Commonwealth Player must plan two months in advance
(unless specified in a given Scenario) for the arrival of Replacement Points via
Production. Thus, for Points required for August, 1942, the Commonwealth Player
must plan — using the Production Systems. — in the first Naval Convoy Schedule
Phase of July, <<19_2>>. However, the Commonwealth Player always uses the
Production Table for the month (one months in the future) in which he wishes his
units to arrive — not the month in which he is consulting it.

[#20_73]*[20.73]* The Commonwealth Production System functions like the Axis
Pools except for Infantry and Truck Points. The Player uses a random dice roll
to determine what Infantry and Truck Points he receives per turn, depending upon
the date of arrival.

[#20_74]*[20.74]* Replacement Points scheduled for any given turn must be
divided among the OpStagesas evenly as possible. This refers to the total Points
for all types. Thus the Commonwealth Player may bring 10 Medium Trucks in one
OpStage and 10 Infantry Points in the next.

[#20_75]*[20.75]* Replacement Points listed in the Reinforcement Schedule arrive
in addition to any Production. The Commonwealth Player has no Shipping Problems;
his Replacement Points simply arrive.

[#20_76]*[20.76]* All Planned Replacements arrive in any hex in Cairo or
Alexandria. They, like other Replacements, must undergo Training (see Case
20.43).

[#20_77]*[20.77]* The Commonwealth Player may “upgrade”? his Infantry units in
much the same fashion as his Recce/AC units. This applies only to infantry units
with a <<1_2>> (Off/Def) Close Assau]t Rating. The Commonwealth Player simply
uses one Infantry Replacement Point for each TOE Strength Point in the unit he
wishes to upgrade. Furthermore, the Commonwealth Player must upgrade a// TOE
Points in that unit at the same time. The Replacement Point used is absorbed to
increase the Assault Rating to <<2_2>>; it does not increase the TOE Strength
itself. No upgrading may take place before the July <<1_1>>, 1942 Game-Turn,
which means they may be “planned”' in June, <<19_2>>. Infantry Replacement
Points scheduled for upgrading need not be Trained. Once upgraded additional
replacements assigned to that unit only require | Infantry Replacement Point per
TOE Point, not 2 (1&1) Infantry Replacement Points.

[#20_78]*[20.78]* Commonwealth Production System (see Charts and Tables)

[#20_8]
=== COMMONWEALTH MANDATORY WITHDRAWALS

During the Desert Campaign, Commonwealth units were often withdrawn and sent
elsewhere (Crete, Greece, Syria, Iraq, Cyprus, Sudan, etc.).  This is reflected
in the Commonwealth Reinforcement Schedule, which tells the Commonwealth Player
if, when, and how many units must be removed from the game.

[#20_81]*[20.81]* Withdrawals are listed in the Reinforcement Schedule. They are
listed as either actual units or as types of units (e.g., "Withdraw any two
Armor Brigades").

[#20_82]*[20.82]*. When a Withdrawal is listed by type, the unit chosen for
Withdraw! must be at 75% maximum TOE Strength (at least), or, if no units are up
to that level, the highest TOE Strength-level unit of its type available.

[#20_83]*[20.83]* Units to be Withdrawn must be moved to Cairo or Alexandria on
or before the Game-Turn or Stage they are to be withdrawn. If they are not
present or at required TOE Strength (20.75) by that time, they are eliminated.
(This is a play mechanism to forestall procrastination.) Units so eliminated may
not return (as many Withdrawls do, later in the game).

[#20_84]*[20.84]* Once the units have reached Cairo or Alexandria, they are
simply removed from play.

[#20_85]*[20.85]* If a unit scheduled for Mandatory Withdrawal is less than 75%
TOE Strength, it must be brought up to that level by Replacement Points before
Withdrawal Date (see Case <<20_82>>) or an equivalent substitute unit of similar
type that is at least at 75% TOE strength.

[#20_9]
=== VOLUNTARY COMMONWEALTH WITHDRAWALS

Throughout the Campaign, the Commonwealth was under great military and political
pressure to support a wide variety of activities in such places as Cyprus,
Sudan, Iraq, etc. Case <<20_8>> discusses large mandatory troop withdrawals. In
addition, the Commonwealth, during lulls in action, would often send several ad
hoc battalions to duty elsewhere; these units often shuffled back and forth in
almost random fashion, dependent on the situation. It would be folly to list all
such movements and even sillier to require a Player to follow them.  (We are not
too happy with Mandatory Withdrawals, but such unit absences on a large scale
must be accounted for.) The Commonwealth Player therefore has the option to
withdraw small forces at any time, thereby gaining Victory Points.  Victory
Points are given because these forces would aid campaigns elsewhere, put
additional pressure on the enemy, etc. Returning voluntarily withdrawn units
penalizes the Commonwealth Player. See the Campaign Game Victory Conditions.

[#21_0]
== BREAKDOWN

COMMENTARY:

The great problem with the desert was not really the heat, which was bad enough.
The major problem was the incredible wear and tear that vehicles incurred. The
desert got into everything, and this deadly combination of heat, sand, and rocky
ground wreaked havoc on all moving parts. Tanks used to going <<10_0>> miles
without an overhaul would collapse after one day's hard travel. The rules for
Breakdown and Repair attempt to simulate this facet of the Desert Campaign. Like
many other rules in CNA, Breakdown requires working with a lot of numbers. The
rule itself is simple; it is the record-keeping that will tax the imagination
(and patience). Sheets for Breakdown and Repairs are provided.

GENERAL RULE:

Essentially, all vehicles, except motorcycles and those vehicles assigned
(abstractly) to gun units (Artillery, Anti-Tank, AA/Flak, etc.) are subject to
Breakdown. Whether a given unit will break down depends on the distance traveled
and the type of terrain encountered in a given Operations Stage. Furthermore,
certain types of vehicles break down faster than others, and this is taken into
account. In general, each type of terrain has a Breakdown Factor, and for each
hex entered during movement the moving vehicle accumulates Breakdown Points.
When the unit ceases movement, the Player totals the Breakdown Points
accumulated, consults the Breakdown Table, adjusts the Breakdown Point Column
for vehicle type, and rolis two dice, adding them together. The result is the
percentage of vehicles (of a given type) in that unit that have Broken down.
Broken down vehicles may not move, defend or attack. They are represented by
Broken down Unit Counters.  Broken down units may be captured (by the Enemy) or
retrieved (by the owning Player). Either way, Broken down vehicles may be Towed
back to a Repair Facility for Maintenance, or they may be Repaired in the Field
(see Section <<22_0>> for Repairs).

CASES

[#21_1]
=== WHICH UNITS BREAKDOWN

[#21_11]*[21.11]* Only the following vehicles are subject to Breakdown: Truck
Points, tank, armored reconnaissance/armored car and self-propelled gun TOE
Strength Points whether they comprise part of a unit or are Replacement Points.

[#21_12]*[21.12]* Each specific type of TOE Strength Point has its own Breakdown
Adjustment Rating (BAR). BAR's are listed below and in the various Tank & Gun
Characteristics Charts. For example, an Italian M <<13_40>> has a BAR of 2R
while the Commonwealth Sherman has a BAR of zero.

[#21_13]*[21.13]* The Breakdown Adjustment Rating is used to adjust the
Breakdown Points column to the left or right when rolling to determine
Breakdown.

Gun Characteristics Chart.

[#21_15]*[21.15]* Vehicles are never required to check for Breakdown when moving
to, from or amongst the Axis off-map Tripoli/Tunisia boxes.

[#21_2]
=== WHEN BREAKDOWN OCCURS

[#21_21]*[21.21]* Each hex (or rather the terrain in the hex) possesses a
Breakdown Point Value, which is listed on the Terrain Effects Chart (8.37). In
addition, certain types of hexsides (e.g., Wadis) also have a Breakdown Point
Value. The Breakdown Point Value is the number of Breakdown Points a motorized
unit or vehicle accumulates when moving into that type of terrain/hex and/or
through that type of hexside. Breakdown Point Values for given terrain types may
be modified by Weather (see Section <<29_0>>).

[#21_22]*[21.22]* Combat does not cause Breakdown, although any movement
(Retreat, Reaction, etc.)  does accumulate Breakdown Points.

[#21_23]*[21.23]* As a vehicle or motorized unit (see Case <<21_11>>) moves, it
accumulates Breakdown Points.  All of the vehicles/motorized units in a stack or
Parent formation accumulate the Breakdown Points for given terrain. Example:

(see bottom of this page)

[#21_24]*[21.24]* Whenever a vehicular or motorized unit ceases movement —
whether it has finished its Movement for that Operations Stage or will be moving
again under the Continual Movement Rule — the owning Player must check for
possible Breakdown.

[#21_25]*[21.25]* Ali Breakdown Points garnered by a unit during a given
Operations Stage are accumulated until the end of that Stage. Simply because a
Player checks for Breakdown for a unit does not mean those Breakdown Points
accumulated up to that point are discharged; they continue to accumulate up
until the end of the Stage (see Case <<21_26>>). In other words, Breakdown Points
are cumulative within an Operations Stage — and they are cumulative and
applicable during both Players' portions of the Operations Stage.

[#21_26]*[21.26]* If a unit has had a Breakdown check during an Operations Stage
(regardless of whether or not it actually suffered any Breakdown), it is
required to check for Breakdown again only if it has accumulated enough
Breakdown Points to carry over into the next highest Breakdown Point Column on
the Breakdown Table (21.38). Example: The LII (M) Battalion (in Case <<21_23>>)
had accumulated 15 Breakdown Points the first time it moved. During the same
Operations Stage it moves again, but it moves only one hex, accumulating 2 more
Breakdown Points for a total of 17. As it is still in the same column (21-30;
because M/13's adjust +1 columns _ higher because of their Breakdown Adjustment
Rating), it need not check for Breakdown when it stops.  However, in the same
Operations Stage, but in the opposing Player's movement, the LII retreats,
accumulating 10 more Breakdown Points, for a total of 27. As it is now in a new
(higher) column, the unit must check again for Breakdown. A unit does not check
for each column; it checks only when it stops, if it is in a higher column.
Note: the Breakdown Rate is virtually geometrically progressive — the further
you move the worse it gets.  The Player is penalized for moving, stopping,
moving, stopping, etc.

[#21_27]*[21.27]* A unit does not check for Breakdown until it has accumulated
more than threee Breakdown Points, regardless of that unit's Breakdown
Adjustment Rating.

[#21_28]*[21.28]* Breakdown is determined separately for each type of unit:
Trucks, Tanks (including S.P.  Guns), or Armored Recce and A/C vehicles.
Furthermore, if there are tanks and/or Guns

In the above example, the Italian LI] (M) Tank Battalion — containing, for
example's sake, all M/13's — has accumulated 15 Breakdown Points for the
illustrated movement: 4 Breakdown Point

within a stack/Parent formation with differing Breakdown Adjustment Ratings the
Player checks separately for each group of tanks andGuns witha different Rating.
A different Breakdown diceroll is used for each separate type.

[#21_29]*[21.29]* Important: In addition to Case <<21_28>>, Players must check
separately for each type of unit in a stack that is in a different Breakdown
Point column.

Example: A Recce unit moves and accumulates 15 Breakdown Points, entering.a hex
with a second Recce unit (which has not moved), Recce #1 continues to move along
with Recce #2, both units picking up 23 more Breakdown Points.  Recce #1 has
accumulated 38 Breakdown Points, Recce #2, 23. Recce #1 and Recce #2 determine
their Breakdown separately, because they are using different Breakdown Point
columns.

[#21_3]
=== HOW BREAKDOWN IS DETERMINED

[#21_31]*[21.31]* To determine Breakdown, the Breakdown Table (21.38) is used.
Each column on the Breakdown Table corresponds to a Range of Breakdown Points
accumulated. Thus <<31_40>> means anywhere from 31 to 40 Breakdown Points
accumulated at the time of Breakdown check (all fractions are rounded up:
<<20_5>> = 21). The Breakdown Table uses two dice, read sequentially. :

[#21_32]*[21.32]* After the Player checking for Breakdown notes the Breakdown
Points accumulated for a given unit, he takes into effect any Breakdown
Adjustment Rating (21.13) as well as any adjustments to Breakdown Rates because
of Weather (see Case 21.37). These two are cumulative: a 2 column left Breakdown
Adjustment Rating plus a_ onecolumn-higher shift for Weather makes for a final
adjustment of one column lower.

[#21_33]*[21.33]* Units accumulating more than 71 Breakdown Points use the 71+
column. You cannot adjust higher than that column, and that column is considered
as one column for purposes of adjustment. Units that have their column adjusted
lower than the <<4_10>> column do not suffer Breakdown.  Remember the
adjustments are in columns, not in points accumulated.

[#21_34]*[21.34]* Having determined the Breakdown Column, the Player throws two
dice, reading sequentially , and cross-referencing that diceroll with the
Breakdown Column. The result is the percentage of TOE Strength Points Broken
down within the units for which the Player is rolling (remember Cases <<21_28>>
and <<21_29>>). Each Truck Point is equivalent to a TOE Strength Point for this
purpose. (Remember that it is the TOE Strength Points that break down, not the
units.) Example: A stack with 30 Truck Points and 20 TOE Strength Points of
Crusader I's accumulates 35 Breakdown Points and stops. The Player checks for
Breakdown. The Trucks have a Breakdown Adjustment for each of the two Road hexes
(it was using Road Movement), 8 for entering the Rough terrain hex, 2 for
crossing the Ridge hexside and 4 for entering the Clear Terrain hex.

Rating of 2L, and the Weather is Hot, so the 31-40 column is adjusted one lower
(—2 and +1 = —1). The Player rolls a 33, consults the <<21_30>> column and sees
that 10% of his Truck Points (or 3 Truck Points) have Broken down. He then
checks for his Crusaders: they have a Breakdown Adjustment Rating of 1R, plus 1
more for the Hot Weather, adjusting the <<31_40>> column up to the 51-60 column.
The Player rolls a 61, and 33% (or 1/3) of his Crusader I's — or 7 TOE Strength
Points — have Broken down.

[#21_35]*[21.35]* All Breakdown fractions are rounded up, (as the <<6_7>> Tank
TOE Strength Points in Case 21.34 became 7). Exception: If the Player is
checking for a unit that has only one TOE Strength Point, all percentage results
of 10% are ignored.

[#21_36]*[21.36]* All breakdowns must be distributed as evenly as possible
amongst types of vehicles as well as different units. Thus, if two German Panzer
battalions, each with different types of tanks (all German tanks have a
Breakdown Adjustment Rating of zero) suffers 25% Breakdown, the Breakdown must
be distributed proportionally as to all types of tanks and between the different
Panzer battalions.

[#21_37]*[21.37]* Weather affects the Breakdown Rates/Columns as follows
(consult also <<29_0>>):

a. Normal Weather: No Effect.

b. Hot Weather: For each Breakdown check, adjust one column higher (1R).

c. Rainstorms: All Road Breakdown Point Values are treated as Track Breakdown
Point Values.

d. Sandstorms: If at least 50% of a unit's Move ment (calculated in Capability
Points expended) in a particular Movement Phases, Retreat, Reaction, etc., is on
a game-map with Sandstorms ‘adjust the Breakdown column one higher (1R).

[#21_38]*[21.38]* Breakdown Table

(see Charts and Tables)

[#21_4]
=== BROKEN DOWN VEHICLES

[#21_41]*[21.41]* Breakdown occurs (for the sake of simplicity) in the hex in
which the units checking for Breakdown have ceased movement. However, if a unit
checking for Breakdown started its movement within two hexes (with no Friendly
units, Friendly ZOC's; or impassable intervening terrain) of an Enemy combat
unit /arger than a single battalion, then at least 50% of all TOE Strength
Points that Break down must be placed in the hex in which that unit began
movement.

[#21_42]*[21.42]* When Breakdown occurs, the Player places a Broken Down Vehicle
marker in the hex in which the Breakdown has occurred and records the necessary
information on his Broken Down Vehicles Sheet. Broken Down Vehicle Markers are
numbered so that the Player may keep track of what is represented by each
different marker.

[#24_43]*[24.43]* When a Truck Breaks down, its cargo stays with it, unless
there are sufficient empty Trucks to pick up the slack. Players will note that a
Motorized Infantry battalion that loses even one Truck Point that it cannot
replace will become "un-motorized" because of the rule that the entire
battalion (all TOE Strength Points) must be in trucks for the unit to be
considered motorized.

[#21_44]*[21.44]* Broken down vehicles have no Capability Point Allowance, nor
may they participate in combat of any type. Broken down vehicles may be captured
(by the Enemy) — see Case <<21_5>> — or retrieved by the owning Player (see
Towing, Case <<21_6>>).

[#21_45]*[21.45]* Supplies on broken down Trucks may be transferred to working
Trucks in the same hex at the time of Breakdown at a cost of 2 Capability Points
(the same as to load/unload). Infantry TOE Strength Points in broken down trucks
may ‘dismount'? (1 CP) from the trucks and start walking. Any Capability Points
they have accumulated while in a Truck count against their non-motorized
Allowance of 10 (or 8), with the exception that if they have used more than 10
(or 8) while motorized they are considered to have used only that 10 (or 8) —
not more. If the men and/or supplies are to be picked up by Truck Points that
were not attached to the unit which broke down at the time of Breakdown, there
is a Capability Point cost for Loading.

[#21_5]
=== CAPTURING BROKEN DOWN VEHICLES

[#21_51]*[21.51]* Broken down vehicles may be captured by the Enemy. Players
should differentiate between the capture of Broken down vehicles and (1) the
capture of Destroyed Tanks (see Case <<14_5>>); as well as (2) the Capture of
abandoned vehicles.

[#21_52]*[21.52]* At any time during movement, if a Friendly combat unit of
battalion-size or larger moves adjacent to a Broken Down Vehicle marker that
vehicle (or vehicles) is captured.

[#21_53]*[21.53]* Broken down vehicles that are either stacked with Friendly
combat units, HQs, or Engineers, or in a Friendly-controlled hex may not be
Captured.

[#21_54]*[21.54]* The capturing unit and the broken down vehicle must be
adjacent through passable terrain; i.e., a German Panzer battalion at the bottom
of an Escarpment could not capture Enemy Broken down tanks at the top of the
escarpment because the German tanks cannot move across and up an escarpment
hexside.

[#21_35]*[21.35]* Captured Broken down vehicles may be placed (towed) a maximum
of three hexes in any direction at the instant of capture. The path of this
placement, which costs no Capability Points to any unit involved, may not be
traced through Enemy units, Enemy Zones of Control or nonpassable terrain.
(Units being towed are considered vehicles). Note: The capturing unit does not
expend any Capability Points for this activity, and may indeed continue to be
moved.

[#21_6]
=== TOWING

[#21_61]*[21.61]* All vehicles scheduled for repairs at a Repair Facility —
including Broken down vehicles and destroyed tanks, whether retreived by the
Friendly Player or captured by the Enemy Player — may be towed to a Repair
Facility in order to undergo repairs.

[#21_62]*[21.62]* Only vehicles not undergoing Field Repair (or any other type
of repair) may be towed. All towing occurs in the Repair Stage, except for
instances such as Case <<21_55>>.

[#21_63]*[21.63]* There are no towing vehicles (however, see <<22_6>> and <<22_7>>).
Rather, each Broken Down Vehicle marker or Destroyed Tank marker may move 10
Capability Points per Repair Phase. They may move only in the Repair Phase, and
they may not React or Retreat Before Combat, etc. The marker is towed as though
it is a Medium Truck.

[#21_64]*[21.64]* No vehicle may ever be towed if it is in an Enemy-controlled
hex with the exception of towing at the instant of capture (see Cases <<21_55>>
and 14,53). This restriction applies at a// times during the Repair Phase.
Friendly units negate Enemy Zones of Control.

[#21_65]*[21.65]* Towing incurs no costs for Fuel, Stores or Water. Towed
vehicles do not undergo Breakdown.

[#21_66]*[21.66]* A Broken down vehicle that unsuccessfully undergoes Field
Repairs may not be Towed in that Repair Phase.

[#21_67]*[21.67]* Broken down vehicles and destroyed tanks must be towed towards
the nearest Tem porary or Major Repair Facility, if they are being towed.

[#22_0]
== REPAIR

GENERAL RULE:

Broken down vehicles and destroyed tanks may be Repaired and returned to action.
Repairs may be undertaken in the field or at Temporary or Major Repair
Facilities. Vehicle repair expends supplies.

PROCEDURE:

Vehicles may undergo Repair in the Repair Phase of the Operations Stage. The
Phasing Player rolls one die for each type of vehicle he wishes to Repair and
checks the variety of Repair Schedules, dependent upon the type of unit, the
type of Repair (Breakdown or Destroyed Tanks) and the type of Facility. The
dieroll results in the number of TOE Strength Points repaired (Field Repairs) or
a percentage of the units which are successfully repaired (Facility Repairs). As
Repairs are attempted, supplies are expended, whether the repairs are successful
or not. Repaired vehicles are returned to play in the form of Truck Points or
Replacement Points — for Tanks and Recce units — (see Case 20.2).

CASES:

[#22_1]
=== WHICH VEHICLES MAY BE REPAIRED

[#22_11]*[22.11]* A Player may attempt to repair all Broken down vehicles as
well as any tanks destroyed in combat, whether they are his nationality or not.
The only requirement is that he control the vehicles in question.

[#22_12]*[22.12]* All repairs are undertaken in the Repair Phase of each
Operations Stage. Only the Phasing Player undertakes repairs.

[#22_13]*[22.13]* Repairs may not take place under the following circumstances:

a. If the vehicles to be Repaired are in an Enemycontrolled hex, regardless of
the presence of Friendly units in the hex. The only exception to this is if the
vehicles are in a Major Repair Facility, in which case the presence of an Enemy
Zone of Control has no effect; or :

b. If there are no supplies available for Repairs (see Cases <<22_2>> and
<<22_3>>); or

c. The vehicles have been towed during the Repair Phase; or

d. The Weather is Rainstorm or Sandstorm for that hex. This does not apply to
Major Repair Facilities.

[#22_14]*[22.14]* The Commonwealth Player may repair all his vehicles together
(within the further restrictions below). However, the Axis Player must repair
German vehicles separately from Italian vehicles. Captured vehicles are also
repaired separately.

[#22_2]
=== FIELD REP AIRS

[#22_21]*[22.21]* Players may attempt to repair Broken down vehicles in the
field. Destroyed tanks may not be repaired in the field; they must be towed toa
Facility (exceptions: see Cases <<22_6>> and <<22_7>>).

[#22_22]*[22.22]* Field Repairs may take place in any hex in which there is a
Broken down vehicle stacked with a Friendly unit of any type, even a Squadron
Ground Support Unit (see Case <<22_13>>a). Field

Repairs may not be made if the vehicle in question has been towed in that Repair
Phase (see also Case <<22.6>>).

[#22_23]*[22.23]* To repair trucks in the field, the Player rolls one die for
Broken down trucks in the hex in question. If he rolls a 2 he may repair one
Light or one Medium Truck Point. If he rolls a 1 he may repair two Light or two
Medium Trucks (or any combination of Light and Medium equal to two) or one Heavy
Truck. Field repair of Trucks requires no expenditure of supplies.

[#22_24]*[22.24]* To field repair armored cars and/or Recce TOE Strength Points,
the Player rolls one die for all the A/C's and Recce points in the hex. If he
rolls a ] he may repair one such TOE Strength Point. No supply expenditure is
required for field repair of Armored Recce or Armored car points.

[#22_25]*[22.25]* To field repair tanks or self-propelled artillery the Player
consults the Broken Down Vehicle Repair Table (22.8) under the column for “Field
Repair." He throws one die for each type of tank undergoing repairs. Thus, it
the German Player has PzII's and PzIV Specials in the same hex, he rolls once
for the PzII's and once for the PzIV Specials. The result is the percentage of
tanks of that type in that hex that have been repaired. All fractions are
rounded up, unless there is only one TOE point undergoing repair. In such case
the Player ignores the 10% result.

[#22_26]*[22.26]* For each tank TOE Strength Point to undergo field repairs, the
Player must have present in the hex and expend before rolling for repairs one
Fuel Point. He may attempt to repair only those Tank TOE Strength Points he has
expended Fuel for.

[#22_27]*[22.27]* Weather affects Field Repairs; see Case <<22_13>>d.

[#22_28]*[22.28]* Players will note that field repairs are a risky proposition.

[#22_3]
=== FACILITY REPAIRS

[#22_31]*[22.31]* There are two types of Repair Facilities: Temporary Facilities
and Major Facilities. Temporary Facilities may be constructed by the Players
(see Case <<24_8>>), and those in existence at the start of a scenario are
designated in that scenario. Major Repair Facilities are found in Tripoli (the
Tripoli Box), Tobruk (for whoever controls it), Alexandria and Cairo (all
hexes). The effectiveness of Repair facilities may be reduced or neutralized by
bombing (see Cases <<22_35>> and 39.37) and Artillery Barrage.

[#22_32]*[22.32]* If a Broken down Vehicle or Destroyed Tank beings a
Maintenance Segment in a hex with a Repair Facility and that vehicle has not
been Towed during that Operations Stage such vehicle(s) may undergo Repairs.

[#22_33]*[22.33]* Players Repair by type of vehicle: Truck Points, Recce/AC
Points, Brokendown Tanks and Guns by Type, and/or Destroyed Tanks by Type.

[#22_34]*[22.34]* For each type of Brokendown vehicle the Player rolls one die
and consults the Broken Down Vehicle Repair Table (22.8) under the correct
column (Temporary or Major Facility). The dieroll may be modified by the effects
of bombing on the Fortification Level of the city (see Case <<22_35>>).  The
result of the dieroll is the percentage of that type of vehicle that may be
Repaired (see Case 22.25 for details). See Case <<22_4>> for Destroyed Tanks. ,

a. If the Repair Facility is in a Major City and the Enemy Player succeeds in
reducing the Fortification Level of that City by one (see Air Bombardment Table)
add one to the dieroll. If the level is reduced by two or three add two to the
dieroll (whether reduced by Air Bombardment and/or Barrage).

b. If the Repair Facility is not ina Major City and the Enemy Player delivers
enough Air Bombs or Artillery Barrage that, when/if using Air Bombardment Table,
to reduce a Fortification one Level, that Repair Facility is neutralized for
that OpStage. It may not repair any vehicles.

[#22_35]*[22.35]* For each Truck Point, Gun or Tank TOE Strength Point
undergoing repair the Player must have present in that hex and expend (before
rolling for Repairs) one Store Point-and one Fuel Point.  He may attempt to
repair only those points he has expended supplies for.

[#22_36]*[22.36]* Temporary Repair Facilities may be affected by Weather (see
Case <<22_13>>d). Major Facilities are never affected by Weather.

[#22_37]*[22.37]* If a Temporary Repair Facility is in the ZOC of an Enemy unit
it may not be used for Repairs unless it is in a Major City. Major Repair
Facilities may be used when in Enemy ZOC's.

[#22_38]*[22.38]* See Case <<24_8>> for how to construct a Temporary Facility.

[#22_4]
=== REPAIRING DESTROYED TANKS

Destroyed tanks — represented by Destroyed Tank markers — may be repaired and
put back into service. Players may repair any destroyed tanks — theirs or the
other player's — that they can get toa Repair Facility. See Case <<14_5>>.

[#22_41]*[22.41]* Destroyed tanks may be repaired only in Repair Facilities.
Destroyed tanks may not be repaired in the field. However, see Cases <<22_6>>
and 22.7.

[#22_42]*[22.42]* For each and every destroyed tank TOE Strength Point a Player
wishes to attempt to repair, he must expend two Stores and two Fuel Points
(Logistics Game only). These supplies must be present in the hex and a// such
supplies must be expended before any repair attempts are resolved.  le., before
rolling the die for any repair attempts, the Player must decide how many
attempts he will make and "pre-pay" for them. Supplies must be expended for all
attempts regardless of whether they are successful or not. (Note that this is
not the case with repairing aircraft.)

[#22_43]*[22.43]* In order to attempt to repair a Tank TOE Strength Point, the
owning Player rolls one die and consults the Destroyed Tank Repair Table (see
Case <<22_44>>). The die must be rolled separately for each such tank TOE
Strength Point. If the attempt is successful, the TOE Strength Point is
considered repaired; if unsuccessful, it is either considered permanently
eliminated ("junked") or nothing happens, in which case another repair attempt
may be made.

[#22_44]*[22.44]* Destroyed Tank Repair Table

(see Charts and Tables)

[#22_5]
=== REPAIRED VEHICLES

Repaired vehicles are treated as Replacement Points for that type of unit. See
Case <<20_2>>. They must have fuel to move again, and they follow all the rules
laid down for Replacement Points, except that they do not have to undergo
Training.

[#22_6]
=== THE DESERT TANK DELIVERY ORGANIZATION

The Commonwealth had special Tank Delivery Squadrons which were used to speed up
the recovery, repair and training of Tank Units. In addition, they held any
Reserves available.

[#22_61]*[22.61]* The Commonwealth Player receives, over the course of the game,
three Tank Delivery Squadrons, which comprise the Desert Tank Delivery
Organization (a name, not a HQ unit).

[#22_62]*[22.62]* Each Tank Delivery Squadron counter isa sort of "advanced"
Field Repair Facility. If-a Brokendown Tank is in the same hex as a Tank
Delivery Squadron the Commonwealth Player may subtract one from his dieroll for
Field Repair (22.2). For Destroyed Commonwealth Tanks, TDS's repair on a die
roll of "1". They do not ‘junk'? and they may not repair Enemy tanks.

[#22_63]*[22.63]* Each Tank Delivery Squadron has no combat ratings of any type
(see Case <<22_64>>) and has no Stacking Points. They have a CPA of 25 as
vehicles but may never voluntarily exceed that CPA or move into an Enemy Zone of
Control. If alone in a hex and an Enemy combat unit places the TDS in its ZOC
the TDS is eliminated. An eliminated TDS may be returned to play eight
Game-Turns after its elimination.

[#22_64]*[22.64]* Each TDS may hold up to three TOE Strength Points of Tanks as
Reserves and still maintain a Stacking Point value of "0". These Reserve TOE
Tank Points are treated the same as any Tank Replacement Points.

[#22_65]*[22.65]* In addition to the above capabilities, DTS's may Tow
Brokendown or Destroyed Tanks back to a Facility at a movement rate of 20 CP's'
(as opposed to the normal 10 for towing). DTS's may tow up to three TOEB's of
tanks (in addition to any Reserves); it still has a Stacking Point Value of “0”.
DTS's may not attempt Field Repair ina turn in which they tow.

[#22_66]*[22.66]* TDS's that have, for any reason, exceeded their CPA in a given
OpStage may not attempt repairs in the ensuing OpStage. They may still tow.

[#22_7]
=== GERMAN MOBILE TANK REPAIR SQUAD

The German Mobile Tank Repair Squad is treated exactly the same as the
Commonwealth Desert Tank Delivery Squadrpons, with the exception that they may
repair only German Tanks (not Italian or captured Commonwealth). There is one
German Mobile Tank Repair Squad counter.

[#22_8]
=== BROKEN DOWN VEHICLE REPAIR TABLE

(see Charts and Tables)

[#23_0]
== ENGINEERS

GENERAL RULE:

In CNA Engineer units are used to aid in construction of a variety of items, as
well as helping to repair facilities that have been destroyed. They are also
useful in laying and removing minefields.  Realistically, engineers had a great
deal more usage than we have given them in this simulation.  However, we have
abstracted a goodly number of those uses, as the "thesis" of the simulation does
not lie in the direction of Engineer capability.  There are three types of
Engineer units: Engineer Battalions, Engineer companies, and Headquarters Units
with Engineer capability.

CASES:

[#23_1]
=== ENGINEER UNITS

[#23_11]*[23.11]* Engineer counters have no real combat value, nor do they exert
Zones of Control. They are not combat units in any way, shape, or form.
Engineer units may never enter Enemy-controlled hexes voluntarily, and they may
use their parenthesized strength only if they are stacked with a Friendly combat
unit.
