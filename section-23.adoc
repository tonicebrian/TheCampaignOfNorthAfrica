== ENGINEERS

GENERAL RULE:

In CNA Engineer units are used to aid in construction of a variety of items, as
well as helping to repair facilities that have been destroyed. They are also
useful in laying and removing minefields.  Realistically, engineers had a great
deal more usage than we have given them in this simulation.  However, we have
abstracted a goodly number of those uses, as the "thesis" of the simulation does
not lie in the direction of Engineer capability.  There are three types of
Engineer units: Engineer Battalions, Engineer companies, and Headquarters Units
with Engineer capability.
