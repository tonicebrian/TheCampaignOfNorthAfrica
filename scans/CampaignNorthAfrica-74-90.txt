hex may attempt to blow a particular dump per
Player-Turn. To blow a dump, the attempting
Player must expend Capability Points equal to
one-third (rounded up)of the attempting unit’s
basic CPA. The attempting Player may never ex-
pend more than the unit’s basic CPA attempting
to blow a dump moreover, a unit may not exceed
its CPA to blow adump.

To blow a dump, the Player expends the necessary
CPAs and rolls one die and modifies the die roll if
necessary for unit size, dump ownership, location,
etc. The Player may adjust the die roll by announc-
ing, before rolling the die, that he is expending an
additional one-third or two-thirds of the attemp-
ting unit’s basic CPA. Cross index the modified
die roll with the percentage of supplies row on the
Supply Dump Demolition Table (54.17) to deter-
mine the percentage of each type of supply in the
dump that is destroyed. In addition, a unit occupy-
ing the same hex as a supply dump may attempt to
blow that dump as part of a retreat before combat.
The Player may only expend one-third of the
unit’s basic CPA and must vacate the hex
regardless of the result. Supply Dumps may be
blown in any segment of an OpStage.

[54.15] Dumps may be used by any Player as sup-
ply sources. The supply dump counters have ID
numbers on them so that the Player may facilitate
record-keeping, including which dumps are Dum-
mies.

[54.16] It is suggested that Players set up their
dumps so that each is within a one-OpStage truck
ride (including loading and unloading time) from
the next. Otherwise you are asking for trouble.
Establishing a viable dump network should be top
priority for logistics commanders.

[54.17] Supply Dump Demolition Table
(see Charts and Tables)

[54.2] TRUCK CHARACTERISTICS
CHART (see Charts and Tables)
The use and mechanics of trucks is discussed in
many places. Let it suffice to repeat that it is of
primary importance that the Player set up a system
whereby his trucks are constantly in use, ferrying
supplies forward as fast as they can. The carrying
capacities of one Truck Point for each type of
truck are listed on the Chart; see Charts and
Tables.
*It requires two light trucks to carry one TOE
Point of infantry; it is suggested that light trucks
not be used for this task.

[54.3] THE COMMONWEALTH
RAILROAD: Supplies

[54.31] As stated previously, the Commonwealth
railroad may be used to move personnel in any
direction. It may also be used to move supplies. It
may move either supplies or personnel — it cannot
move both at the same time.

[54.32] The Commonwealth supply capacity of
the railroad is 1500 tons per Operations Stage in
either direction. The RR may move personnel in
one direction and supplies in another. Players
should check the various Sections on supplies to
see the equivalent weight in tons for each type of
supply.

[54.33] The railroad may transport only one type
of supply at a given time. It may move fuel, am-
munition, or stores — not any combination of the
three. (Water need not be transported by RR —
the railroad hexes are pipelines in and of
themselves.)

[54.34] For the duration of one Operations Stage
per month (calendar month), the railroad may not
be used for anything. It is transporting water for-
ward for railroad use. Players must state each

month which Operations Stage they are not using
the railroad.

[54.35] Like personnel, supplies may be moved
from any one spot and dumped in another spot.
Supplies are considered unloaded when they reach
a specific hex. They may not be moved that Opera-
tions Stage.

(54.4) AXIS USE OF THE COMMOR-
WEALTH RAILROAD

Under certain conditions the Axis Player may
make use of the coastal railline extending from
Egypt to Libya (the Commonwealth railroad
system). In essence, he must control the rail hexes
and he must import rolling stock. Remember, the
Barce railroad east of Benghazi is not usable under
any conditions.

[54.41] At any time the Axis player controls five
or more continguous rail hexes he may use such
rail hexes to transport equipment and personnel.
To control a rail hex the Axis player must be the
last player to have a land combat unit of any type
pass through that hex.

[54.42] The Axis Player may never build new rail
line. However, he may repair rail hexes he controls
at the same rate as the Commonwealth Player.

[54.43] To make use of controlled Com-
monwealth Raillines the Axis Player must convoy
Rolling Stock (locomotives, tenders, stock cars,
flat cars, etc.) from Europe to Africa. For each
250 Stores and 100 Fuel Points that the Axis Player
imports to Africa and brings to any controlled and
operative rail hex he may activate all such hexes
under his control (as long as they are contiguous)
to the extent of hauling 300 Tons of Supplies in
any one direction during an Operations Stage.
(Rail movement occurs in the Convoy Stage).

[54.44] In order to transport one Stacking Point
of any.type of unit the Axis Player must have ac-
tive enough Rolling Stock to transport thé
equivalent of 900 Tons of Supplies in any one
direction.

[54.45] Once Stores and Fuel is applied as Rolling
Stock the points are used up; they may not be
recovered. If at any time the Axis Player loses
control of enough rail hexes so that he does not
have the necessary five contiguous hexes the Roll-
ing Stock is considered to have been destroyed.
The Axis may not use Commonwealth Stock, nor
vice versa.

[54.46] All rules concerning the movement of

troops/supplies and the use of the railroad that ap-

ply to the Commonwealth apply equally to the Ax-

is.

[54.5] EQUIVALENT WEIGHTS CHART
(see Charts and Tables).

[55.0] PORTS
AND SUPPLY
[55.1] PORT CAPACITY AND USE

[55.11] There are two types of ports: major ports
and minor ports. Major ports may receive both
men and supplies; minor ports may receive only

supplies. Both types of ports may ship out men

and supplies.

[55.12] Every port in the game has an Efficiency
Level, which is an abstract number assigned to
that port. For example, Tobruk has an Efficiency
Level of 5. This Efficiency Level indicates the level
of efficiency at which the port is operating. The
Efficiency Level of the port may be reduced by
various Enemy activities, all discussed previously.

[55.13] In addition to its Efficiency Level, each
port has a specific limit (capacity) as to the number

of TOE Strength Points and/or tons of supplies
that may enter and leave that port; this is called the
port capacity. (See the Port Capacity and Efficien-
cy Level Chart, 55.3.)

[55.14] The amount of troops and supplies that
can be brought into or out of a port depends on its
current Efficiency Level and its capacity. A port
operating at peak efficiency (its level is at max-
imum assigned) uses its listed capacity. A port that
has been reduced by bombing or mines operates at
a lower efficiency directly proportionate to its
reduced Level. Thus, a port with an assigned Effi-
ciency Level of 5 that has had its Level reduced to 3
operates at 3/5 (or 60%) or its assigned capacity.
Therefore, all incoming and outgoing shipments
are reduced to 60% of original level. Example:
Benghazi has a supply tonnage capacity of 2500
tons per OpStage. It has a maximum Efficiency
Level of 3. If this Level has been reduced to 1, its
supply receiving capacity is reduced to 1/3 of 2500
(or 834 tons). Round all reductions upward to the
nearest ton.

[55.15] In addition to any reductions brought
about by Enemy action, the fact that troops are be-
ing debarked at a port — as opposed to supplies
(fuel, ammo, etc.) — may reduce its Efficiency
Level vis a vis supplies for the OpStage or Game-
Turn in which the troops arrive. The arrival of
scheduled reinforcements (those that arrive man-
datorily, via the Reinforcement Schedule), as op-
posed to those which the Players plan, etc., do not
affect a port’s capacity or Efficiency Level.

[55.16] Some ports may receive shipments only in
a Strategic Phase, while others may be used each
OpStage. Players should be careful to adjust ali
capacities and Efficiency Levels to cover both
uses. A port’s capacity applies to a// shipments
received in a Game-Turn (including OpStages), ex-
cept as stated in Case 55.15.

[55.17] The port of Bizerta (Tunis Box) is an
unusual case. Although nominally open to the
Axis via Vichy France, on Hitler’s request it was
never used (for various convoluted reasons). To
add to that, it is quite a long way to the front —
even if it is out of range of most Commonwealth
planes. In any case, Bizerta is non-operable until
the start of the June 1, 1941 Game-Turn. Starting
with that Game-Turn, the Axis Player throws two
dice each Game-Turn. If he throws a 12, he may
use Bizerta from that turn on. It remains in-
operative until the Game-Turn that he does throw
al12.

[55.18] For every OpStage that a port does not
lose any Efficiency Levels to Enemy bombs, it
regains one point. Exception: Cases 55.26 and
55,27. It can never go above its maximum assigned
level (see Case 55.3).

[55.2] BLOCKING HARBORS

Either Player may reduce the effectiveness of a
port he actually occupies by scuttling ships in the
harbor to block other ships from entering. This
was done notably at Benghazi by the Axis,.thereby
reducing the effectiveness of Benghazi (as a port)
to almost zero during the entire war. Enemy
Players may also mine opposing ports.

[55.21] A Player who controls a port may desire
— for whatever reason occurs to him — to block
up the harbor. Each harbor being different, the
ability to do this varies with the port. The ports at
Bizerta, Tripoli, Alexandria, Aboukir (E3815) and
Rosetta (E4019) may not be so blocked.

[55.22] In order to block a port harbor, the Player
must have an engineer battalion or CW HQ with
engineer capacity present in the port hex. He then
expends 25 Ammunition Points and 10 Stores
Points, which must be actually present in the hex,

23

24

in the Construction Phase. The Efficiency Level of
the port is reduced by one (see Case 50.14).

[55.23] All ports are reduced at the same rate,
with one exception: it requires the expenditure of
50 Ammunition Points and 25 Stores Points to
reduce Tobruk port one Level.

[53.24] A port may be reduced one Level per
Operations Stage; it may never be reduced more,
regardless of the expenditure of supplies.

CL 2/6

eth
San Giorgio

[55.25] Players will note that at the start of the
game, the Italian cruiser San Giorgio is partially
blocking the harbor of Tobruk. The San Giorgio
reduces the efficiency level of Tobruk by three
levels.

[$5.26] The effect of blocking harbors may be un-
done only by Friendly engineer battalions or CW
HQ with engineering capability. Engineers reverse
the process of 55.22. However, for each port, it
costs 50 Ammunition Points and 25 Stores Points
to undo the damage, at one level capacity per
Operations Stage. There are two exceptions to
this: Tobruk requires only 25 Ammunition Points
and 10 Stores Points to remove one level of block-
ing effect; Benghazi requires the expenditure of
100 Ammunition Points and 50 Stores Points plus
the presence of two engineer units to remove one
level of blocking effect.

[55.27] Harbors may also be blocked by Enemy
bombers laying mines by air (see Case 41.3 for the
mechanics). Each successfully laid mine lowers the
Efficiency one level. Mines may be removed by
engineer battalions. If there are mines in a harbor,
and the Player controlling the harbor has an
engineer unit (as in Case 55.26) in that harbor, he
rolls a die for each mine in the harbor. A roll of 1-3
removes the mine; a roll of 4-6 and the mine re-
mains. Mine removal is done in the Construction
Stage, and the engineer unit may not move or
voluntarily expend CPA’s in that Stage. The
engineers cannot be involved in any other con-
struction or removal work.

[55.28] CW ships in an Axis port hex have no ef-
fect on Convoy arrivals. (This is somewhat of an
abstraction; attempts to block the ports during the
day would not have worked due to Axis air
power:)

[35.3] PORT CAPACITY AND
EFFICIENCY LEVEL CHART
(see Charts and Tables)

[56.0] THE AXIS NAVAL
CONVOY SYSTEM

GENERAL RULE:

Almost everything the Axis needs for its desert
campaign must be shipped in from Italy and the
Aegean. Supplies and personnel are sent in con-
voys. Convoys are planned one Game-Turns in ad-
vance and the route of the convoy (the shipping
lane it will use) is also chosen at that time. Each
convoy is given in tonnage, and the Axis allowable
tonnage depends on the month, year, and roll of
the die. It may be further depleted by Com-
monwealth bombers. In addition, the capacity of
each port is limited as to the tonnage it may
receive, and that facet will also limit the Axis plan-
ning. The Axis Player has a limited amount of
coastal shipping which he may use to transfer
small amounts of supplies from one coastal port to
another.

CASES:

[56.1] THE SHIPPING LANES

[56.11] There are six Shipping Lanes in CNA,
representing the various routes taken by Axis con-
voys. The Shipping Lanes are not printed on the
game map but rather are identified by their ports
of origin and destination (see the Axis Naval Con-
voy Air Distance Chart).

[86.12] An Axis convoy is defined as the total ton-
nage assigned to a Shipping Lane during a Game-
Turn. The Axis Player may have as many as six
convoys or as few as one during any Game-Turn.
The Axis Player is restricted to the listed ports of
origin and destination combinations (i.e., he may
not create additional shipping lanes).

[56.13] Axis Naval Convoys may be attacked by
Commonwealth bombers (see Axis Naval Convoy
Strategic Bombing, 41.6). The Axis Player must
therefore balance the risks in having a convoy ar-
rive close to the front, thereby placing it within
range of a greater number of Commonwealth N.
African based planes or having it arrive far in the
rear, trading time and supply expenditures for
safety.

[86.14] Shipping lanes 4 and 5 (the routes
originating from Greece) may not be used until the
second Game-Turn of May, 1941. See also Case
55.17.

[56.15] All Axis convoys are assigned to a specific
shipping lane in the Axis Convoy Planning Phase.
The lane assignment may not be changed,
regardless of any changes in the positions of the
land units, with one exception: a convoy scheduled
to arrive at a port that is captured by the Com-
monwealth is cancelled. It never sails.

[56.16] The Axis Player notes on his Convoy Con-
trol Sheet what he is shipping and through which
lane. If that shipping lane is not attacked by Com-
monwealth planes, all items arrive at their
designated port (which is stated as part of the
lane). If the lane is under bombardment, the Axis
Player totals the tonnage in that lane and divides
by 1000 to obtain his Flak/AA Points for that con-
voy. Thus 15,000 tons of shipping would amount
to 15 Flak/AA Points with which to fire at Com-
monwealth planes. Any losses are taken as per the
strategic bombardment rules.

[56.17] There is no limit to the tonnage that can be
carried by a convoy in a given lane, except as noted
in Case 56.2.

[56.2] SHIPPING BY CONVOY

Many different methods of determining arrival
rates and times of Axis convoys were considered in
designing this game. Each one had several merits
— all had drawbacks. We chose this method (using
the actual tonnage figures for a given month) over
the other less easy to determine methods. No one
was completely satisfied with any of the methods.
(The drawback with the chosen method is that the
arrival rates may not coincide with Axis needs.)
But both designer and developer were loathe to
tackle the problem of Italian ship-building,
availability of supplies in Italy, and a whole host
of other problems. Thus the rules below reflect the
arrival of Axis supplies as they actually occurred
(within the parameters of the rules).

[$6.21] Axis shipping of supplies by naval convoy
uses several charts, under the heading of the Axis
Naval Convoy Level Chart. The Axis Convoy
Capacity Table refers the Axis Player, by month
and year, to the Tonnage Capacity Table for that
particular month. The figures given on the Ton-
nage Determination Table are the tonnage of sup-
plies that the Axis may ship in that Game-Turn
(for which he is planning).

Example: The Axis Player, at the beginning of
Game-Turn 54 (October IV, 1941), makes his
plans for his shipping and convoys for Game-Turn
55 (November I, 1941). (Remember, while Axis
replacements are planned two turns in advance,
the Axis Player always plans his convoys one
Game-Turn prior to actually sending them out.)
The Axis Monthly Shipping Table tells the Axis
Player to use row E on the Tonnage Capacity
Table for November 1941. The Player refers to
that Table and column and rolls a die; he rolls a 4.
That means he may ship 21,000 tons of supplies
and Replacement Points (see 20.00) on Game-
Turn 55. The choice of shipping lane and destina-
tion is up to him.

[56.22] Having determined the allowable tonnage
for a given Game-Turn, the Axis Player may now
plan to ship any amounts (within the limits of
allowable tonnage) of. fuel, ammunition, and
stores that he wishes. They are available (for game
purposes) in unlimited quantities in Europe. For
example, with those 21,000 tons available on
Game-Turn 55 (November I, 1941), the Axis
Player may decide to ship out 10,000 tons of fuel,
10,000 tons of ammunition, and 1000 tons of
stores.

[56.23] The tonnage equivalencies of supplies are
listed on the Equivalent Weight Chart (54.5)
[36.24] The Axis Player may also have planned
previously (see Case 20.6) to ship replacements
from Italy/Greece. These take up space and
weight, and their tonnage equivalencies are given
in the Equivalent Weight Chart (54.5). Only
Replacement Points not arriving via the Rein-
forcement Schedule affect shipping tonnage; rein-
forcements and scheduled replacements do not use
convoys and do not affect shipping tonnage. Thus
if the Axis Player had planned to send 10 Infantry
Points in the Game-Turn 55 convoys, this would
subtract 300 tons from the available tonnage for
that Game-Turn.

[56.25] After determining what tonnage he has
available and what he wishes to ship, the Axis
Player then, at the same time, allocates his
available tonnage to the lanes — and ports — he
wants them to use. He cannnot change lanes and
destinations once chosen (see Case 56.1).

[56.26] Axis convoys — and their cargoes — may
undergo Commonwealth bombardment.

[86.27] The Axis Player should remember that
ports have maximum capacities; they may not
receive supplies over that capacity (see Case 55.3).

[56.28] Supplies and personnel are unloaded the
instant of their arrival, (if possible) and they may
be used immediately. All ports of arrival (e.g.,
Tripoli, Bizerta, Tobruk) are considered to have
supply dumps built in, as it were.

[56.3] AXIS COASTAL SHIPPING

The Axis had a small fleet of boats that they used
for coastal transfer of small amounts of supplies.
These were old shipping boats and aging tramp
steamers that could ill afford to venture too far
from land. They havea limited capacity.

[56.31] Axis coastal shipping is represented by
several ship counters. Each ship counter has its
tonnage capacity printed on it. Each ship has a
CPA — for movement only — of 50. Each sea hex
costs one point.

[86.32] Axis coastal shipping moves in the Truck
Convoy Phase, and on/y in that Phase.

[56.33] Axis coastal ships cannot be attacked
from air or land. They may not enter a port that
has been neutralized (Capacity Level of zero).
They may also never enter an Enemy-occupied
port.

[56.34] To use coastal shipping, the Axis Player
loads supplies (xo personnel) on his boats at the
Beginning of the Truck Convoy Phase (at a cost of
5 CPs) and then moves the boat. Unloading sup-
plies costs 5 CPs. Only one type of cargo may be
carried at any one time by any one ship. Tanks,
guns, etc., may not be shipped via coastal shipping

[56.35] Coastal ships may stop and unload in one
port and then continue on to another port, etc., as
long as they do not exceed their CPA. Coastal
ships do not require fuel.

[57.0] COMMONWEALTH
SUPPLY BASE

GENERAL RULE:

The Commonwealth Player has an unlimited
amount of supplies of all types — fuel, ammuni-
tion, water, and stores — in Cairo at all times dur-
ing the game. His problem is solely to get it to
where he wants it. He does not ship supplies in; if
he wants something, it is in Cairo. Remember,
Commonwealth ships need no supplies. For rein-
forcements and replacements for personnel and
equipment, the Commonwealth Player should
consult his Reinforcement Schedule and CW
Replacement System (see Section 20.0)

[58.0] ABSTRACT
AIR RULES

COMMENTARY:

This Section covers the rules required for the
Players to play the Land and Logistics Games
without utilizing the Air Game rules. CNA’s play
is relatively unaffected by the lack of an Air Game,
the adjustments required being made in the
Player’s ‘‘trucking”’ ability.

CASES:

[58.1] EFFECT ON AXIS
NAVAL UNITS

Attacks on Axis naval convoys are conducted us-
ing the same procedure listed in the Basic Logistics
and Air Rules of the Land Game (see Section
32.0). The only difference is that the convoy being
attacked is now more detailed as to what it is
transporting. Note that the Axis coastal shipping
and both Players’ tactical shipping may not be at-
tacked.

[58.2] COMMONWEALTH
FLEET BOMBARDMENT

The Axis Player is entitled to make attacks on the
Commonwealth fleet. Such attacks utilize the
same procedure as that in the Basic Logistics and
Air Rules described in the Land Game (see Section
32.0).

[38.3] EFFECT ON SUPPLIES

There is only one restriction — the Axis Player
loses three-quarters of all fuel actually brought in-
to a port on the instant of its unloading (con-
sidered to be used for airplanes). This loss is incur-
red before any loss for evaporation is calculated.

[58.4] EFFECT ON TRUCKS

[58.41] The Players’ initial set-ups will be reduced
by a certain number of Truck Points (those assign-
ed or that would be assigned the task of supplying
the air facilities).

[58.42] Both Players are subject to truck losses in
addition to those caused by land combat. These
losses represent the abstracted effects of strafing
and bombing the opposing Player’s trucks. The
losses are determined in the same manner as those
for motorization points (see Case 32.57) using the
percentage loss figures in the Abstract Motoriza-
tion Point Loss Chart (32.59) but applying them to
the Players’ trucks.

The owning Player may remove the lost Truck
Points from any place he wishes. However, losses
must be distributed in proportion by truck type
and by proportion of trucks in convoy and those
attached. Example: A Player possesses 50 Light,
100 Medium, and 50 Heavy Truck Points
distributed as 40 Light and 10 Medium in convoy
and the remainder attached. If he is required to
lose 10% of the total Truck Points, he must lose 4
Light and 1 Medium Truck Points from those in
convoy and 1 Light, 9 Medium, and 5 Heavy
Truck Points from those attached.

[58.43] Both Players are subject to a reduction in
their total available truck force in order to account
for the trucks that would be carrying supplies to
their air facilities. Both Players lose 10% (roun-
ding fractions up) of all truck points that arrive in
N. Africa (the instant they arrive) via the Com-
monwealth Truck Production Table and the Axis
Replacement Pool. Trucks listed on the reinforce-
ment track are not affected.

SCENARIOS

[59.0] INTRODUCTION
TO SCENARIOS

COMMENTARY:

There are five scenario groups in Campaign for
North Africa. Each scenario group contains at
least one separate game. Of course, one is for the
playing of a campaign game. The groups cover
what the designer felt were the most important —
and most accessible, in terms of information —
areas of the campaign. Specific battles, such as
Gazala, were avoided as they did not fit within the
concept of the game (operational). Each scenario
is a self-contained game and each highlights cer-
tain problems.

Those wishing to get the most out of CNA without
becoming enmeshed in a lifetime occupation are
advised to try the Rommel’s Arrival scenario — it
is fast-moving and a lot of fun. It is also not too
long or difficult (the small number of units involv-
ed keeps paperwork to a minimum). For those in-
terested in seeing why trucks are so important and
want to keep all their work in a small area, try the
Italian scenario. For those interested in seeing a lot
of units sit around doing nothing, try El Alamein
—aremarkably boring situation (in game terms, if
not historically).

Players should take great care in setting up each
scenario, as a great deal of information is provid-
ed. The bigger scenarios could take 10 to 15 hours
to prepare. A further word to the Africa buffs:
given all the information in the game, it should be
fairly easy to concoct your own situations and
scenarios. Your major problem would be logistical
information.

On the subject of Victory Conditions, it is the
designer’s feeling that, in a game of this size and
scope, few Players will patiently battle through
100-200 hours of playing time and feel they have
actually lost (or won). Finishing is an event in
itself. The Victory Conditions have been thought
out carefully, in light of not only what was actually
accomplished, but also what had to be accomplish-
ed. Yet the conditions are somewhat general,
especially the campaign game objectives. This is
because outside considerations that could not
possibly have been simulated had to be taken into
effect. Any Player worth his salt will know
whether he has accomplished what he set out to do
without checking what we’ve told him he must do.

CASES:

[59.1] SCENARIO ORGANIZATION

[59.11] The scenarios in CNA are divided into five
groups. The first four of these groups deal with in-
dividual battles or offensives, and the fifth covers
the campaign game.

[$9.12] Each of the first four scenario groups con-
tains the following information:

a. Length of the scenarios in the group.

b. Victory Conditions of the scenarios in the
group.

c. Initial location and strength of all land and air
forces.

d. Initial location and amount of all supplies.

e. Initial location and number of all trucks.

f. Forces available on Malta & Crete/Italy/Sicily.
g. Abstractions necessary to play the scenarios
without the Air and/or Logistics Games.

h. Special rules for the individual scenarios.

[$9.2] HOW TO READ
THE SCENARIO SET-UPS

Basically, all air and land units, supplies, and
trucks available at the start of a scenario are listed
by hex location. Generally, the parent unit will be
listed, and Players must refer to the appropriate
OA Chart to determine which subordinate units
are assigned to that parent unit. Whenever a given
unit has a composition different from the one
listed on the OA Chart, that is noted in paren-
theses.

Hex Location. If more than one hex is listed for a
given group of units, the Player may divide the
listed units between the hexes in any way he
chooses, so long as stacking limitations are not ex-
ceeded.

Unit Type. If not apparent from the name, this is
noted with an abbreviation. Where noted, it is
always the first item enclosed in parentheses.
I = infantry; R = reconnaissance (recce);
T = tank; Ar = artillery; AT = anti-tank;
AA = anti-air; HQ = headquarters (the head-
quarters counter only).

Parent of Listed Unit. If the listed unit has been
assigned to a parent unit (whether or not it still is),
that parent unit’s designation is listed, in bold
type, as it appears on the listed unit’s counter. This
is to facilitate identification of the listed unit.

Listed Unit Lacks Subordinate Units Originally
Assigned. All such subtractions from what is listed
on the OA Chart are noted after the indicator
“Less.’’

Listed Unit Includes Subordinate Units Not
Originally Assigned. All such additional units
(which may be detached) are listed after the in-
dicator ‘‘Assg.’’

Assigned Subordinate Units Are Detached. These
are listed under the parent unit after the indicator
“‘Det.’’ Of course, they are listed separately in the
hex(es) they themselves are in.

25

26

Listed Unit Has Entirely New/Different Roster of
Assigned Units from Those Listed on OA Chart.
AJl subordinate units listed after indicator ‘“‘“Con-
sists of.”

Note. Whenever a unit inside parentheses requires
expanded explanation, that explanation is enclos-
ed inside double parentheses: e.g., (f....)).

Listed Unit Exceeds Formation Organization
Limits. Such units may operate normally, in-
cluding being themselves assigned and/or attach-
ed, with the exception that no new subordinate
units may be assigned or attached to them, and
should any units be detached, no new ones may be
attached in violation of the limits.

Listed Unit Includes Subordinate Units Attached
But Not Assigmed. All such units are listed after
the abbreviation ‘‘Att.”’

Disposition of the Units in a Hex. All units listed
to begin in the same hex may be organized as the
owning Player chooses, within the limits of the
Formation Organization rules and stacking limita-
tions. In other words, units in the same hex may be
freely detached or attached to each other at the
start of the scenario, in any fashion deemed
desirable.

Trucks. All listed trucks are first line trucks and
must be assigned to the units in the hex, in any
manner deemed desirable.

Abbreviations Used in Scenario Set-Ups.

ment; Bn = battalion; Coy = company;
In = Indian; Gds = Guards; RTR = Royal

Tank Regiment; RHA = Royal Horse Artillery;
Hus = Hussars; SA = South African;

organization.

[59.3] INITIAL AIR STRENGTHS

[59.31] Each scenario lists the starting Axis and
Allied plane types, numbers, pilots, air facilities,
and squadron ground support units. This listing is
divided into forces available in North Africa and
Malta for the Allied Player and to forces available
in North Africa and Sicily/Italy/Crete for the Axis
Player.

[59.32] Planes are listed by type, with the ready
planes indicated as a portion of the total available.
All planes (refitted or not) are considered to begin
a scenario fueled and armed (at no cost to the sup-
plies available).

[59.33] Planes may be distributed among the
squadron ground support units as the owning
Player desires within the restrictions on squadron
composition listed in Case 35.2.

[59.34] Pilots may be assigned to planes and
squadrons as the owning Player desires.

[59.35] Squadron ground support units may be
placed on any of the air facilities owned by the
Player. However the number of SGSU’s may not
exceed an air facility’s readying capability.

[59.36] Maintenance may not be _ performed
onplanes during the first OpStage of a Scenario.

[59.4] INITIAL TRUCK STRENGTHS

[59.41] Trucks initially available to each Player
are divided into Ist line, 2nd-3rd line available for
supplies, and 2nd-3rd line available for air
facilities,

[59.42] First line trucks are listed by hex in the
land forces initial deployment section of the
scenario. These trucks must be assigned to units in
their listed hex. The trucks may be divided among
the units in that hex in any manner the Player
desires.

[59.43] Second-third line (in convoy) trucks
available for air facilities must be placed on an air
facility.

[59.44] Second-third line trucks available to
transport supplies must be placed (if the Axis
Player is not starting them off-map) on a hex oc-
cupied by a Friendly combat unit, a supply dump,
or a major city/town/oasis. These trucks may be
distributed as the owning Player desires.

[59.45] Trucks may start a scenario transporting
supplies or motorizing troops or anti-aircraft units
at no cost or penalty. Any trucks starting with sup-
plies may load any type of supply. These supplies
are in addition to those listed in the supply section

of the scenario.

[59.5] INITIAL SUPPLY 12

[59.51] Each scenario lists the location and
amounts of a Player’s initial supplies.

[59.52] The supplies are divided into those
available at air facilities and those available at sup-
ply dumps. Air facilities automatically possess a
supply dump. If a Player places supplies available
at a supply dump in the same location as those
available at an air facility, the totals are combined
and it becomes one dump (see Case 36.17). Some
scenarios separately list an aggregate number of
supplies available at a player’s air facilities.:- These
may never be allocated to off-map facilities.

[59.53] Certain scenarios list a Player as receiving
active and non-active supply dumps. Non-active
dumps are dummy dumps and cannot, therefore,
be placed in the same hex as an air facility.

[59.54] Axis coastal shipping begins all scenarios
unloaded (i.e., empty).

[59.6] ABSTRACT LOGISTICS AND AIR

[59.61] If only the Air Game is abstracted, the
Players simply ignore all Trucks and supplies
available at/for Air facilities in the initial set-ups.
Play is then governed by the rules in Section 58.0.

[59.62] If the Logistics Game is abstracted,
whether or not the Air Gameis also abstracted,
Players will be using Motorization Points and Sup-
ply Units. The initial set-ups for the Supply Units
and Motorization Points are given in the following
cases.

[59.63] Initial Motorization Point Strengths: The
initial motorization points available to each Player
are calculated from the trucks listed in the scenario
set-up.

A. Attached Motorization Points: These are
calculated, hex by hex, from the Ist Line trucks
available to the Player unless specifically modified
by a Scenario’s instructions. Each Medium Truck
and each Heavy Truck is equal to one Motoriza-
tion Point. Example: In the first Scenario Group,
the 4th CCNN is listed as beginning the scenario
with 10 Light, 25 Medium and 10 Heavy Trucks. It
possesses 35 Motorization Points.

B. Unattached Motorization Points: These are
calculated from the second-third Line trucks
available to each Player in the same manner as in
“A.” If the Air Game is being abstracted, ignore
all trucks available atair facilities. Note that the in-
itial distribution/placement of these trucks will af-
fect their ability to start a scenario loaded with
supplies in addition to those listed as available in
supply dumps (see Case 59.66).

[59.64] Initial Motorization Point distributions
may be, with one exception (see Case 59.66 ‘‘B’’),
freely altered once the game starts as per the Land
Game rules on attachment and detachment.

[59.65] Supply Units: The Player’s initial supply
levels are listed as to the number, location, and

contents of regular and depot supply units
available. Regular supply units are described in
Section 32.0. Depot supply units — used only if
the Air Game is being played and the Logistics
Game is being abstracted — are described in Sec-
tion 47.0. Initial supply unit placement may exceed
stacking limitations only if unavoidable due to
scenario distribution instructions. There is no
penalty in such situations; however, no additional
supply unit may be stacked in that hex. Once the
supply unit distribution meets stacking restrictions
all normal stacking restrictions for that hex must
be met from that point on. (Remember that
motorization points transporting supply units do
not count against hex stacking limits.)

{[59.66] Additional Supplies:

A. Motorization Points may begin a scenario
loaded with supplies. These do not count against
supplies listed in the scenarios supply dumps.

B. Each attached Motorization Point (see Case
59.63 ‘‘A’’) not initially transporting men or guns
may start loaded with 1 Ammo Point or 3 Fuel
Points. the unit must consume these supplies first
(i.e., it may not draw on a supply unit) in order to
meet any supply expenditure requirement. These
supplies may not be transferred to a supply unit.
The Motorization Points transporting these sup-
plies may be detached from the unit only if remain-
ing attached to a subsidiary combat unit of that
parent unit (Note that the Motorization Point is
under this réstriction only while it is transporting
these initial supplies).

C. Unattached Motorization Points (see Case
59.63 ‘‘B’’) are divided into those that are listed as
initially available at air facilities (these appear only
if playing the Air Game) and all other unattached
Motorization Points. Air facility Motorization
Points may begin by transporting additional supp-
ly units as follows: Each 50 Motorization Points in
a hex may start with a depot supply unit; each 30
Motorization Points in a hex may start with a
regular supply unit. Each 30 other unattached
Motorization Points in a hex may start with a
regular supply unit. Example: 80 air facility and
100 other Motorization Points may begin with the
air facility points transporting one depot and one
regular supply unit while the other points may
begin with three regular supply units. Note that for
these Motorization Points to begin with a supply
unit they must be in groups of 30 (and/or 50 if air
facility) points (i.e., 20 Motorization Points may
not begin with a supply unit). The Tripoli/Tunisia
boxes are hexes for the purposes of this Case.

[60.0] SCENARIO GROUP
ONE: The Italians

CASES:
[60.1] GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The first scenario group covers the initial months
of the desert fighting, from 15 September 1940
through the middle of February 1941. Although
there was an actual state of war existing between
the British and the Italians vis a vis Libya/Egypt,
the months of June through early September 1940
have been ignored as there was little done other
than aggressive patrolling. The actual campaign
starts with the first Italian offensive and subse-
quent British counter-attack.

[60.2] SCENARIO LENGTH

{60.21] There are two separate scenarios in the
Italian scenario group; each may be played
separately to a specific conclusion.

[60.22] Graziani’s Offensive

This scenario starts with Game-Turn 1, OpStage 1;
it ends with the conclusion of Game-Turn 6,
OpStage 3. The estimated time of play is anywhere
from 25 to 50 hours. Victory Conditions are listed
in Case 60.71.

[60.23]. The Italian Campaign

This scenario starts with Game-Turn 1, OpStage
1, and proceeds through the end of Game-Turn 20,
OpStage 3. It includes Operation Compass
(O’Conner’s counteroffensive). The estimated
time of play is 90 to 150 hours. Victory Conditions
are listed in Case 60.72.

[60.45] Commonwealth Fleet: The Com-
monwealth Player has a total of one battleship,
three cruisers and seven destroyers available at the
beginning of the campaign. These are deployed ac-
cording to the Commonwealth Fleet Schedule (see
Section 30.0). The warships may not be moved un-
til the first OpStage of the second Game-Turn.
Their combat ratings are unaffected (i.e., they do
not need repair and may fire).

The following units are available and in Port at
Alexandria:

Number Type
2 Battleships
2 Cruisers
4 A. A. Cruisers
6 Destroyers

The following units are in Valetta, in Malta:

Number Type
1 Cruiser
1 A. A. Cruiser
2 Destroyer

No Fleet units may be moved until the September
1/IV Stage/Turn. All ships may use their AA
Ratings.

AA: 17 AA Points distributed as player sees fit

State of Air facilities: The Malta bases have an in-
itial capacity of five SGSU’s. These may be spread
amongst the Malta facilities as the player wishes.
Construction on increasing the capacity of Malta
Air Facilities may begin in October, 1940.

[60.47] The Commonwealth Player uses his Rein-
forcement Track as printed, bringing in units
where and when listed (Remember that some units
need Training, which means that other units have
to be assigned as Training Units!) No Replacement
Points may arrive before November 1940.

[60.5] AIR FACILITIES

The following Air Facilities are in existence.
Players will note that Air facilities may be used by
anyone Who controls them. All facilities in Egypt

belong to the Commonwealth; all those in Libya
belong to the Italians. at the start of the game.

[60.6] INITIATIVE

For this Scenario Group, the Italian Player has the
Initiative for the entire first Game-Turn. Starting
with the second Game-Turn, players determine In-
itiative as per the rules for such.

[60.7] CONSTRUCTION ON THE MAP
AT THE START OF THE GAME
There are no minefields, fortifications, or pipeline
(other than those provided by the RR). The RR
runs to Mersa Matruh (D3714) and ends there. All
ports are at listed Efficiency with the exception of

Tobruk, which is at Efficiency Level 7 (the San
Giorgio is partially sunk, blocking the harbor).

[60.8] FIRST SCENARIO GROUP
VICTORY CONDITIONS

[60.81] Grazianni’s Offensive

Italian Strategic Victory: The Italian Player must
take and hold either Alexandria or Cairo (any hex)
with a combat unit that can be supplied (by con-
voy) from any hex on Game-Map D.

Italian Decisive Victory: The Italian must take
and hold (occupy) both Mersa Matruh and Siwa
with any combat unit that can be supplied by con-
voy from Tobruk.

Italian Tactica] Victory: The Italian must take
and hold (occupy) Sidi Birani and retain posses-
sion of Sollum (C4021) and Fort Maddalena and
Giarabub in supply (as above, to Tobruk)

Commonwealth Tactical Victory: Must take
and hold Sollum and Halfaya Pass (C3922) as well
as Siwa (C0127) tracing supply by truck convoy
back to Alexandria or Cairo.

Commonwealth Decisive Victory: Must take
and hold Bardia, Fort Maddalena, Sidi Omar,
Sollum and Siwa, supply as above.

Commonwealth Strategic Victory: Must take
and hold Tobruk; supply as above.

[60.82] The Italian Campaign

Players are awarded points for holding (occupy-
ing) the following locations. Units holding such
places must be combat units (i.e., units with non-
parenthesized Close Assault Ratings) and they
must be able to trace supply of not more than one
Game-Turn’s duration back to a Supply Dump or
City which can eventually be traced back either to
Cairo (Commonwealth) or Tripoli (Italian).

Victory Points

Commonwealth

City/Village Italians Hold Holds
Mersa Matruh 100 0
Tobruk 50 25
Derna 20 30
Giarabub 10 10
Siwa (C0127) 10 10
Benghazi 10 50
Agadabia

(A2629) 10 50
Mersa Brega

(A202) 0 50

If there are no Italian combat units that can trace a
Supply Line on the game-map the Commonwealth
Player wins a Strategic Victory. All other condi-
tions produce a simple ‘‘Victory’’. Most points
wins. These conditions are based on what actually
happened, and less on actual objectives.

[60.9] AIR & LOGISTICS GAMES
ABSTRACTIONS

This Case lists the adjustments needed in addition
to those given in Case 59.6 in order to play this
scenario without the Air and/or Logistics
Game(s).

The Commonwealth Player places the following
Trucks in Alexandria or Cairo:

Type Number
Light 25
Medium 175
Heavy 35

[61.36] Supply

The Commonwealth Player receives nine Dumps
and three Dummy Dumps. In addition, both
Benghazi and Tobruk are supply dumps.

The Dumps may be placed at any of the following
locations: Msus (B 4004), Tecnis (B 5407), Mar-
tuba (B 5526), Mechili (B 4921), Timimi (B 5229),
El Magrun (A 3729), Barce (B 5504), Mersa Brega’
(A 2021), Derna (B 5925), Agadabia (A 2629),
Tocra (B 5501) and Sceledima (A3933). All Dumps
must be placed. (Historically, the first nine were
actual dumps, with Msus and Tecnis being the ma-
jor dumping areas.)

Benghazi holds 100 Fuel Points, 50 Ammunition
Points, and 150 Stores. Benghazi also has 10
Points of Italian Prisoners, a POW Camp, and
one Commonwealth Guard.

Tobruk has 500 points of Fuel, 1500 Ammunition
Points, and 1000 Stores.

The Commonwealth Player has for distribution to
his Dumps the following: 2550 Fuel Points, 1700
Ammunition Points and 1600 Stores. These may
be distributed as the Commonwealth Player sees
fit, with one limitation: no more than 25% of the
total of each item may be placed in a single dump.
Furthermore, all actual dumps must have at least
50 points of each item. All First Line Trucks not
carrying men/equipment may be loaded with
Fuel/Ammo/Stores and Water as the Players see
fit. This is in addition to what is supplied above.
Unlimited supplies in Cairo/Alexandria as per the
rules.

The Commonwealth Player has a Temporary
Repair Facility in Tobruk and one in Mersa
Matruh. Alexandria (either hex) and Cairo have
Major Repair Facilities.

29

30

Air Supply

The Commonwealth Player has 180 Fuel Points,
250 Ammo Points, and 50 Stores for distribution
amongst Air Facilities.

[61.37] COMMONWEALTH FLEET

The Commonwealth Player receives all his fleet
counters in Alexandria. They may not move out of
Alexandria before the first OpStage of Game-
Turn 27. All are armed and undamaged.

[61.38] REINFORCEMENTS/
REPLACEMENTS

Except as listed below, the Commonwealth Player
takes his Reinforcements as they arrive, via The
Reinforcement Track. Replacement Points arrive
in the normal manner; the Commonwealth Player
may not plan any such Replacements and must
start any such planning in the normal course of
events. There are no replacements allowed for
March 1941.

There are several Commonwealth units being refit-
ted, returned from assignments elsewhere, etc.
These units had been either on the way to
Greece/Syria, or in the shops. Plans had to be
changed hastily, yet the scenario must adjust for
the time in which that can be done. In essence, no
units in Cairo or Alexandria may move during the
third OpStage of Game-Turn 26, After that, only
one battalion may be released per OpStage. (Thus
it would take several stages to release the entire
Polish Brigade; you would have to wait the re-
quired time to release all the battalions.)
Remember, also, that battalions will be needed for
Training purposes! In addition to the above, the
18th Australian Brigade appears in Alexandria on
the first OpStage of April, 1941. It may move (by
rail, sea or land) on the succeeding OpStages of
April, 1941 (in addition to any of the above units.

The 7th Armored Division presents a special case.
It had been chewed up pretty badly in the previous
six months’ action; its tank battalions were a mess
and its infantry and support units worn to the
bone. The unit was in Alexandria for a complete
refit. At the start of the scenario, all 7th Armored
tanks are considered Brokendown. The 7th’s Tank
battalions may not be released until they are at
least 75% repaired, and then they may be released
only one per OpStage. In addition, one more non-
tank battalion may be released and sent westward
per OpStage, all starting with the first OpStage in
April. HQ units may be released at any time the
player wishes. At the time of this scenario the 7th
Armoured contained the following units: 4th Ar-
mrd Brigade (6 RTR reassigned, ARTR assigned);
7th Armrd Brig; 7th Support Grp.

For the purposes of the above Release Schedule,
the 22nd Guards Brigade counts as one battalion.

[61.4] AXIS FORCES
[61.44] Axis Land Forces

All German land units that are scheduled to arrive
before the third OpStage of Game-Turn 26 (See
Reinforcements Schedule) may be placed within
one hex of El Agheila (A1816) but not east of that
village. The Axis Player may place them in any
formations he wishes (using Battle Groups, if he so
desires). The Italian Player has six Divisions on the
game-map: the Ariete Division may be placed
within two hexes of El Agheila, but not east of that
village. The Pavia, Bologna, Brescia and Savonna
divisions may be placed anywhere between Ras el
Ali (A 2010) and Nofilia (A2703) with no divison
less than two hexes from another. The Trento
Division is in Tripoli. Also in Tripoli are the XXI
Corps Artillery, the 350th GaF Artillery Regi-
ment, the 2nd Artillery Ragruppament, and the
Sabratha Division. The Sabratha Division has lost
its 6 infantry battalions (although the 85th and

86th Regimental Headquarters still exist). Its MG
Bn, and Arty Regiment have been reduced to 1
TOE Strength Point each. NOTE that the six in-
fantry battalions and two ‘‘support’’ units may be
rebuilt by Replacements.

All units (except the Sabratha) are as listed on the
OA Sheets (including Tanks).

One Oasis Company (German) is at Maaten
Groter (A 1318) and one at Magadah (A 0817).

[61.42] Axis Airforce

Planes: The Axis Player receives all of the German
planes listed in the Axis Airplane Reinforcement
Chart as shceduled to arrive prior to the 3rd
OpStage of Game-Turn 26. All of these planes are
considered refitted. The Axis Player receives the
following Italian planes:

Total
Type Available Refitted
C.R. 42’s 61 27
G. 50’s 62 33
B.R. 20’s 1 0
SM 79 30 14
Z 1007bis 1 1

Pilots: Italian = 3 THREE, 11 TWO’s and 12 ONE
pilots. German=The Axis Player rolls once to
determine the number of ONE thru FOUR rated
pilots he receives (i.e., the March, 1941 die roll).

SGSU’s: 13 Italian. German SGSU’s are available
as per the Air Game rules (because of Air
Facilities, below).

Air Facilities: The Axis Player may base any por-
tion of his airforce at Italy/Sicily within the
minimum German plane restrictions of Case 43.1
(Crete is still British). The Axis Player may place
one airfield and one air landing strip in any hex
west of El Agheila (A 1816).

16

[61.43] Axis Tracks

AJl German first line Trucks (which are indicated
on the Reinforcement Schedule as being attached
to arrived German units) may be distributed
among those units freely.

The Italian Player receives the following First-
Line Trucks, which may be assigned as he sees fit
to his units:

Type Number
Light 45
Medium 220
Heavy 50

The following Second/Third Line Trucks are
available (for any and all purposes):

Type Number
Light 95
Medium 280
Heavy 50

It is firmly suggested that the Axis Player use these
as Second/Third Line Trucks, otherwise he will
have a hard time moving his Supply around.

Additional second/third line trucks: 10 Medium
Trucks at air facilities.

[61.44] Supply

The Axis Player receives five Dumps, two of which
are Dummies. These dumps may be placed at any
hex between El Agheila and Nofilia.

For division between the three active dumps the
Axis Player has 9600 Fuel Points, 2500 Ammo
Points, 950 Stores, and 1100 Water Points. No
more than 50% of each may be located at any one
dump.

In addition, Tripoli holds 3000 Fuel Points, 1500
Ammunition Points, and 500 Stores.

For distribution to Air Facilities (remember,
Tripoli/Tunisia air facilities have unlimited Fuel
and Ammo) there are 50 Fuel Points and 50 Ammo
Points. The Axis player does not receive a Convoy
during the first game-turn. He must plan his con-
voys for the second and third game-turns.

[61.45] All Axis Reinforcements are taken nor-
mally, as they appear on the track.

[61.5] INITIATIVE

The Axis Player has the Initiative through the end
of Game-turn 27. Players roll for Initiative star-
ting with Game-Turn 28.

[61.6] CONSTRUCTION ON THE MAP
AT THE START OF SCENARIO

The railroad runs to Mersa Matruh (D3714) and
ends there. There are no minefields or pipeline
(other than provided by the RR). All ports are of
full (listed) Efficiency Level except Benghazi (at
zero) and Tobruk (at seven—and San Giorgio is
still there). The Commonwealth Player may place
a total of four Level 1 Fortifications within two
hexes of Tobruk. The unfinished roads connecting
Solium (C4021) and Sidi Barrini (C4131) and the
entire network around Tobruk have been built.

[61.7] AIR & LOGISTICS GAMES
ABSTRACTIONS

This Case covers the adjustments needed in addi-
tion to those given in Case 59.6 in order to play this
scenario without the Air and/or Logistics
Game(s).

[61.71] Air Abstracted (Land & Logistics Games):
The 2nd-3rd Line Trucks available to the Players
are modified as follows:

A. Axis Player: 2nd-3rd Line are now a total of 90
Light; 270 Medium and 40 Heavy.

B. Commonwealth Player: 2nd/3rd Line Trucks
in Alexandria/Cairo are now a total of 25 Light,
150 Medium and 25 Heavy. Other 2nd/3rd Line
Trucks are now a total of 40 Light, 90 Medium and
20 Heavy.

[61.72] Air & Logistics Abstracted
(Land Game Only):

A. The Players’ ability to bring in motorization
points is equal to their respective abilities to bring
in Medium Truck Points (i.e., each Medium Truck
Point equal one Motorization Point).

B. Initial unattached motorization points: The
Axis Player has 290; the Commonwealth Player
has 150 in Alexandria/Cairo and 90 at other loca-
tions.

C. Axis Initial Supply Status: Case 61.43 is replac-
ed by the following: The Axis receives 10 regular
supply units, each with 40 Ammo and 60 Fuel
Points and 3 Dummy supply units which may be
distributed freely (within stacking restrictions) in
any of the road hexes between El Agheila (A 1816)
and Nofilia (A 2703) inclusive. This does not in-
clude the road from E 1716 the Maatan Groter (A
1318). In addition, the Axis Player receives 8
regular supply units, each with 40 Ammo and 25
Fuel Points, in the Tripoli box.

D. Commonwealth Initial Supply Status: Case
61.35 is replaced by the following:

The Commonwealth Player receives one regular
supply unit with 20 Ammo and 30 Fuel Points in
Benghazi (A 4827) and 5 regular supply units, each
with 40 Ammo and 15 Fuel Points, in Tobruk (C
4807). In addition, he receives 9 regular supply

units, each with 40 Ammo and 25 Fuel Points, and
4 Dummy supply units to be divided among the
following locations with the restriction that no
more than 2 regular supply units may be placed at
any location: Mersa Brega (A 2021), Agadabia (A
2629), Sceledima (A 3933), El Magrun (A 3729),
Msus (B 4004), Tecnis (B 5407), Barce (B 5504),
Tocra (B 5501), Martuba (B 5526), Mechili (B
4921), Timimi (B 5229) and Derna (B 5925)

In addition, Cairo and Alexandria each contain
two regular supply units: each supply unit contains
40 Ammo and 60 Fuel Points.

[61.73] Logistics Abstracted (Land & Air Games):
A. The Players’ ability to bring in motorization
points is equal to their respective abilities to bring
in Medium plus Heavy Truck Points (i.e., éach
Medium and each Heavy Truck Point is equal to
one Motorization Point).

B. Axis Initial Supply Status: As in 61.62 “C”
above and in addition 1 regular supply unit with 20
Ammo and 30 Fuel Points may be placed at any
one Axis air facility.

C. Commonwealth Initial Supply Status: As in
61.72 “‘D”’ above plus 1 regular supply unit with
40 Ammo and 60 Fuel Points which may be placed
at any one Commonwealth air facility.

[61.8] VICTORY CONDITIONS

Victory Conditions for The Race for Tobruk
Scenario are fairly simple. The Player who holds
Tobruk at the end of the scenario wins. If the Axis
Player also holds Bardia (C 4321) he wins a
Decisive Victory. If he holds Benghazi-Tobruk-
Bardia plus any two villages/cities in Egypt he
wins a Strategic Victory. If he holds anything less
than the above, it is a Commonwealth Victory.
Furthermore, if the Commonwealth holds all the
above (including Benghazi) it is a Smashing Vic-
tory.

[62.0] SCENARIO GROUP
THIREE: OPERATION
CRUSADER

{62.1] GENERAL DESCRIPTION

Operation Crusader covers the events of the
Winter of 1941-2, in which the Commonwealth
forces attempted to relieve Tobruk (under siege by
the Axis) while, at the same time, Rommel had
planned to strike eastward at the Allied forces in
Egypt. The result was an extended series of battles
in the area between Sollum and Tobruk.

[62.2] SCENARIO LENGTH AND
DURATION

The scenario starts with the 3rd-OpStage of the
57th Game-Turn. The scenario ends with the con-
clusion of the 1st OpStage of the 65th Game-Turn.
The estimated playing time for this scenario is bet-
ween 200 and 250 hours.

[62.5] CONSTRUCTION AT THE START
OF THE SCENARIO

There are no minefields. All ports are at full
(listed) Efficiency. All hexes adjacent to Bardia
contain Level 1 Fortifications. All hexes adjacent
to Tobruk contain Level 2 Fortifications.

The railroad extends past Mersa Matruh.and ends
in hex C 3430. From that point, the pipeline ex-
tends in a straight line as far as Birkhamsa (C
3029). All unfinished roads are built with the ex-
ception of the Siwa Track, which is completed to
only twenty hexes from Mersa Matruh (i.e., the
hex the 1st South African Road Construction Bat-
talion occupies, D2001).

There is a Temporary Repair Facility in Tobruk.
The Commonwealth Player may also place an ad-
ditional Temporary facility in any village/city he
wishes. As usual, Alexandria and Cairo contain
Major Repair facilities.

Temp

Facility

There is a Temporary Repair facility in Derna,
plus one in any other village or city. There is a Ma-
jor Repair facility in Benghazi.

[62.6] AIR & LOGISTICS GAMES
ABSTRACTIONS

This case covers the adjustments needed in addi-
to those given in Case 59.6 in order to play this
scenario without the Air and/or Logistics
Game(s).

[62.61] Air Abstracted

(Land & Logistics Games): None.

[62.62] Air & Logistics Abstracted

(Land Game Only):

A. The Players’ ability to bring in Motorization
Points is equal to their respective ability’s to bring
in Medium Truck Points (i.e., each Medium Truck
Point equals one Motorization Point).

B. Axis Initial Supply Status: Case 62.45 is replac-
ed by the following:

Regular Each with
Location Supply Units Ammo Fuel
Tripoli (box) 2 20 60
Nofilia (A2703) 3 30 25

Derna (B5925) 4 15 60
Group 1* 3 30 50

*These, and in addition 2 dummy supply units, are
to be placed in any of the following locations in
any distribution at the Axis Player’s choice:
Gazala (B4933), Rotunda Segnali (B4432) and any
location(s) on game map-section ‘‘B’’.

Cc. Commonwealth Initial Supply Status: Case
62.35 is replaced by the following:

Regular Each with

Location Supply Units Ammo +t
Tobruk (C4807) 4 40 40
Sidi Baranni (C4131) 3 30 50

Giarabub Oasis

(C1014) 1 40 50
Bar Khamsa (C3029) 1 30 60
Group 1* 4 20 15

*These, and in addition 2 dummy supply units,
may be distributed among the following locations
at the Commonwealth Player’s choice with the
restriction that no more than one regular supply
unit may be placed in any hex: Oxford Circus
(C3532), Bir al Scheferzen (C3419), Sidi Suleiman
(C3721) and. any two. hexes (other than Mersa
Matruh) on game-map-section ‘‘D’’. In addition,
Cairo and Alexandria each contain two regular
py units, each with 40 Ammo and 60 Fuel Points.

[62.63] Logistics Abstracted

(Land & Air Games):

A. The Players’ ability to bring in Motorization
Points is equal to their respective abilities to bring
in Medium plus Heavy Trucks (i.e., each Medium
and each Heavy Truck is equal to one Motoriza-
tion Point).

B. Axis Initial Supplies: As in 62.62 ‘‘B’’ above
plus 1 regular supply unit at each Axis airfield (ex-
cept those off-map) with 30 Ammo and 40 Fuel
Points.

C. Commonwealth Initial Supplies: As in 62.62
““C”? above plus | regular supply unit at each air-
field (except Kabrit) with 30 Ammo and 40 Fuel
Points and | regular supply unit at each remaining
air facility (except off-map) each with 5 Ammo
and 15 Fuel Points.

[62.7] INITIATIVE

Historically, the Commonwealth Player should
have the Initiative for the first OpStage. However,
the Players may roll in the normal manner to
determine who has initiative in that OpStageif they
prefer. In each OpStage after the first, the Players
roll the die as per normal procedure.

[62.8] VICTORY CONDITIONS

Players amass points for controlling geographical
locations. The Player with the most points sub-
tracts the other player’s points from his and then
determines the level of victory, if any.

The Players receive Victory Points for controlling
certain cities/villages. The number of points
depends on the location and the player controlling.
Control of a city/village means occupying that
city/village with a combat unit of any strength.
That unit must have sufficient supplies to exist for
one month and Ammo for one week (one round
each OpStage).

0 Draw/Standoff

Players may wish to compare losses in men and
tanks (as well as air, although that is not that
revealing) to see how well they did, in comparison
to each other, in gaining or not gaining their objec-
tives. Players may wish to subjectively raise or
lower their victory level as per this. However,
losses can be misleading, so this type of condition
is ‘‘officially’’ left out of the conditions here.

[63.0] SCENARIO GROUP
FOUR: EL ALAMEIN
[63.1] GENERAL DESCRIPTION

There are two scenarios which can be played from
this scenario Group. The first is a short scenario in
which the Axis Player has one week (one game-
Turn) to try to break through the Commonwealth
lines and reach Alexandria (a relatively impossible
task). The second scenario is one of survival: can
the Axis army survive the end of the campaign in-
tact? For those familiar with El Alamein they will
realize that both scenarios are, militarily (and in
terms of game-playing) quite stultifying. They are
included for historical reference, mostly.
Playtesting proved them to be as equally dull as
their gaming predecessors. The first scenario has
the advantage of being remarkably short; the other
scenario is for those who like to retreat or chase
fleeing troops.

[63.2] SCENARIO LENGTH AND
DURATION

Both scenarios begin with the Ist OpStage of
Game-Turn 1OZ. ‘‘The Last Chance’’ Scenario
ends with the completion of the 3rd OpStage of
Game Turn 102 lst OpStage of Game-Turn 111.
“The Long Retreat’’ ends at the completion of the
December 3/IV, 1942 Game-Turn. ‘‘The Last
Chance’”’ should take about ten hours to play, ex-
cluding set-up; ‘‘The Long Retreat’’ should take
from 50to 100 hours.

[63.38] Reinforcements and Replacements

All Reinforcements are taken as per the Reinforce-
ment Schedules. Ail Replacements are taken nor-
mally, except that all available points are reduced
to 10%, rounded up, of their listed maximum.
However, the Infantry and Truck Production
Tables’ output are unaffected. In any case, no
Replacement points may arrive before the first
OpStage of Game-Turn 105, and these may be
planned before the scenarios starts. Replacements
for the 106th Game-Turn may also be planned at
the start of the scenario. There are no
Replacements or Reinforcements for the ‘‘Last

[63.45] Axis Supply

The Axis Player receives ten Supply Dumps, three
of which are Dummies. At least five of those
dumps must be placed on Game-Maps A, B or C.
The other five may be placed on game-map D (or
A-C, if desired). In addition, the Axis Plyaer

Each Airfield has 150 Ammo points, 350 Fuel
points, 25 Stores and 50 Water except
Tripoli/Tunisia.

Each Strip, Flying Boat Basin/Alighting Area has
20 Ammo points, 25 Fuel points, 10 Stores and 10
Water Points.

Trucks may be assigned to the dumps, cities as
needed fromthe 2nd-3rd Line Trucks available.

The Axis has a Major Repair Facility in Tobruk,
and Temporary Repair Facilities in Bardia and
Mersa Matruh.

Axis Coastal Shipping (all units/tonnage) is
available. Ships may be placed at any port between
Tobruk and Tripoli.

[63.46] Axis Mediterranean Air Force
Deployment |

The Axis Player may transfer 10% of his available
force to Italy or Sicily but no more. He may not
have more than 10% of his air power in Italy or
Sicily. Strategic air attacks against Malta may be
made only in the Long Retreat scenario (see
44.41).

[63.47] Replacements and Reinforcements

For the ‘‘Last Chance’’ Scenario, ignore all Rein-
forcements and Replacements.

For the ‘‘Long Retreat’’ scenario, Reinforcements
as normal. As for Replacements, Axis Player must
reduce all his Points Available to 5% (rounded
down) of what is listed in the Axis Replacement
Pool. Moreover, any Replacement Points sent
must be sent to Tripoli and must stay there, unless
the following occurs: If the Axis Player still holds
Tobruk, Bardia, or Mersa Matruh by the third
OpStage of Game-Turn 105, then 25% of Replace-
ment Points in Tripoli may be released the follow-
ing OpStage. After that, 25% of all available
Replacement Points (by type, and rounded up)
may be released in the first OpStage of Game-Turn
108.

This rule takes into effect the Allied Landings
(feared and actual) to the West, and the historical
fact that almost all manpower at this time was be-
ing diverted to Tunisia.

[63.48] Upgraded Axis Equipment

A. All eligible Axis armored car and armored
recce units may be upgraded as per rules for such.
It is not necessary to use Replacement Points;
simply upgrade the units as if they had used
Replacement Points.

B. Any two of the four following Italian infantry
divisions may have their assigned artillery units’
OA Sheet listing of two or three 75mm heavy anti-
air TOE Strength Points replaced with two 90mm
heavy anti-air TOE Strength Points: 16 Pistoia,
17i Pavia, 25 Bologna and 27 Brescia.

C. The following German anti-tank units have
their weaponry upgraded replacing their OA Sheet
listing: The 605th SP of the 21st Panzer has 6 TOE
Strength Points of Marder SP anti-tank guns. The
3.7mm anti-tank guns in the 15th and 21st Panzers
are replaced by the same number of 5cm guns. The
Scm guns in the 15th and 21st Panzers and 90th
Light are replaced by the same number of 7.62
Pak(R) guns.

D. Any four eligible Italian brigade-level HQ’s
are ad hoc anti-tank batteries each with 4 TOE
Strength Points of Italian AT guns. Any two eligi-
ble German brigade-level HQ’s are ad hoc anti-
tank batteries, each with 4 TOE Strength Points of
2.8cm anti-tank guns.

E. All Italian artillery units originally assigned to
a division (i.e., as listed in the OA Chart) have
their 75/18 Gun-Howitzer TOE Strength Points
replaced by an equal number of 75/27 guns. The
two self-propelled artillery units in the Littorio
and the two in the Ariete each possess 4 TOE
Strength Points of Semovente 75/18 SP guns.

F. The following German artillery units are
upgraded: The III/220 and III/220 artillery bat-
talions of the 164th Division each consist of 3 TOE
Strength Points of 1S5cmK18 guns and 3 TOE
Strength Points of 15cm sFH18 guns (replacing
their OA Sheet artillery). The 149, 526 and 533
Coastal Defense artillery battalions replace their
artillery with, respectively, 3 TOE Strength Points
of 15cm sIG33 guns, 3 TOE Strength Points of
17cm K18 guns and 3 TOE Strength Points of
21cm Mrs18 guns.

[63.5] SPECIAL RULES

The following rules may not be used:
A. 10th Italian Light Flotilla
B. Raid on Rommel

[63.6] INITATIVE

Historically, the Germans had the initiative during
the first OpStage of this scenario. However, the
Players may at their discretion roll the die to deter-
mine who has the iniative on the first OpStage. (If
the Commonwealth Player gains the initiative for
the fist week, it will be even more depressing than
usual for the Axis Player, of course.)

[63.7] CONSTRUCTION
[63.71] All unfinished Roads have been built.

[63.72] The entire unfinished railroad complex
has been built. However, the RR in the three hexes
immediately west of el Alamein are destroyed.

[63.73] The only pipeline available is that in
railroad hexes. The Axis Player may draw water
through it from Tobruk while the Commonwealth
Player may draw water through it from Alexan-
dria.

[63.74] All ports are at full (listed) Efficiency ex-
cept Benghazi, at Efficiency Level One, and
Tobruk at Efficiency Level Five.

[63.75] Level One Fortifications are placed in the
four hexes adjacent to Tobruk. In addition, the
Axis Player may place a total of three Level One
Fortifications among the four hexes adjacent to
Bardia.

[63.76] Commonwealth Player places minefields
in the following hexes: D3033, and on map-section
E3101, 2901, 2801, 2701, 2702, 2601, 2501, 2401, 2302
and other five hexes (on map-section E). Of the fif-
teen, ten are Real and five are Dummy; the
distribution is at the Commonwealth Player’s
choice. All start the scenario at unknown status
(i.e., face-up).

[63.77] The Axis Player places minefields in the
following hexes of map-section D: 3233, 3133,
3032, 2933, 2833, 2733, 2632, 2633, 2533, 2429,
2433, 2831, 2832, and 2731. Of the fourteen,
eleven are Real and three are Dummy; the distribu-
tion is at the Axis Player’s choice. In addition the
Axis Player may place up to five Real and two
Dummy minefields in any eligible hexes within
three hexes of Tobruk and a maximum of two Real
and two Dummy minefields in any eligible hexes
on game map-section A thru C that are not within
five hexes of Tobruk. (‘‘Eligible’’ refers to the
ability of the Players’ to construct a minefield in
that hex under the normal game restrictions.) All
start the scenario at unknown status (i.e., face-
up).

[63.8] AIR & LOGISTICS GAMES
ABSTRACTIONS

This case covers the adiustments needed in addi-
tion to those given in Case 59.6 in order to play
these scenarios without the Air and/or Logistics
Game(s).

[63.31] Air Abstracted (Land & Logistics Games):
The Commonwealth initial supplies are reduced as
follows: The Front Line Dumps now total 2250

Ammo, 1750 Fuel, 1500 Stores and 1250 Water
Points. The other dumps now total 500 Ammo,
2000 Fuel, 400 Stores and 1600 Water Points (see
Case 63.35).

[63.82] Air & Logistics Abstracted

(Land Game only)

A. The Players’ ability to bring in Motorization
Points is equal to their respective abilities to bring
in Medium Trucks (i.e., each Medium Truck
equals one Motorization Point).

B. Axis Initial Supply Status: Case 63.45 is replac-
ed by the following:

Regular

*These plus 2 dummy supply units may be placed
in any hexes on maps A thru D at the Axis Player’s
discretion except that no more than a total of four
supply units (i.e., regular plus dummy) may be
placed on maps A through C.

+These, and in addition | dummy supply unit, may
be placed in any hexes on Maps A through C.

C. Commonwealth Initial Supply Status: Case
63.35 is replaced by the following: The Com-
monwealth Player receives 13 regular supply units,
each with 40 Ammo and 20 Fuel Points, to be plac-
ed at his Front Line in any fashion with the restric-
tion that at least one regular supply unit must be
placed in each of the following hexes: el Alamein
(E 3002), E 2805 and E 2403. The Front Line is
defined as hexes E 3002, E 2805, E 2403 and any
hex that is east of and adjacent to an Axis unit. In
addition, the Commonwealth Player receives 2
regular supply units, each with 40 Ammo and 60
Fuel Points, which may be placed anywhere on
map E except that neither may be placed within
two hexes of the Front Line (this includes Front
Line hexes not occupied by supply units).

[63.83] Logistics Abstracted

(Land & Air Games):

A. The Players’ ability to bring in motorization
points is equal to their respective abilities to bring
in Medium plus Heavy Trucks (i.e., each Medium
and each Heavy Truck is equal to one. Motoriza-
tion Point).

B. Axis Initial Supplies: As in 63.72 ‘‘B’’ above
plus 2 depot supply units, each with 180 Fuel and
40 Ammo Points, one at Mersa Matruh and one at
Tobruk. In addition, a total of 9 regular supply
dumps, each with 30 Ammo and 50 Fuel Points, to
be distributed among and placed on any Axis air
facilities other than Mersa Matruh and Tobruk.

C. Commonwealth Initial Supplies: As in 63.72
“C”’ above plus a total of 2 depots, each with 40
Ammo and 180 Fuel Points, one each at any Com-
monwealth air facility not within three hexes of a
Front Line hex.

[63.9] VICTORY CONDITIONS

[63.91] ‘‘The Last Chance’’ Scenario
A. The Axis Player wins a Strategic Victory if he

can occupy at least one hex of Alexandria with at
least a Brigade-equivalent unit. Supply doesn’t
matter.

B. Failing the above, the Axis Player totals the
number of TOE Strength Points (any type) on
Game-Map E, the Commonwealth Player totals
those TOE points he has on Game-Map D (ex-
clusive of Layforce and SAS units). The Player
with the most TOE points (in comparison to the
other) is the winner of a tactical victory.

[63.92] ‘“The Long Retreat’’ Scenario

The name of the game is survival here. How good
is the Axis Player at delaying, at giving territory
grudgingly. He cannot win in a military sense (the
Allies are landing, Africa is lost—at least in
retrospect). However, the better he fights,the
more attention the Allies will have to pay to
Africa. Here the Axis Player is playing against ac-
tual history. Can he do better than Rommel on this
retreat? Rommel didn’t do badly; see if you can
best his record (if you don’t fall asleep first). In
essence, the Axis Player gains points for occupying
certain locations. Occupying means that all com-
bat units in that City/Village must have at least
one Game-Turn’s worth of Stores, be able to fire
all weapons twice, and have enough fuel for all
units to move 20 CP’s,

If you have gotten this far you will by now have
surmised that the full campaign game of CNA
is,far and away, the most ambitious undertaking a
gamer could ever want to get involved with. The
campaign game requires not so much a commit-
ment in time (which is always relative), but more
so a commitment to planning and foresight. A
campaign game will need at least ten players,
perhaps more. Ideally, each land division should
have a commander, plus an Air Commander anda
Logistics Commander. On top of this should be
one Player as Supreme Commander. This means a
lot of players, and, again, this is the ideal situa-
tion. The fewest number of players would be three
to a side. Lastly, it would be hard to under-
estimate the amount of paperwork and planning
that are involved in a campaign game. Keeping on
top of the situation is half the battle . . . and more
than half the fun. And speaking of fun, the cam-
paign game can be a lot of fun. If you are in-
terested in a challenge, interested in wrestling with
the problems of organizing and running a cam-
paign, and if you simply want to experience the
complexities of. modern warfare at all levels, you
will get much satisfaction from CNA.

[64.2] SCENARIO LENGTH

There are two campaign game scenarios in CNA.
The first covers the entire war in Northeast Africa
and begins in the third week of September, 1940
(.e., the Italian Offensive, lst OpStage of Game-
Turn 1). The ‘‘shorter’’ campaign begins with the
arrival of General Erwin Rommel and the
Deutsches Afrika Korps during the fourth week of
March, 194] (i.e., the Desert Fox, 3rd OpStage of
Game-Turn 26). Both campaign games end with
the completion of the third OpStage of Game-
Turn 111.

[64.3] INITIAL DEPLOYMENTS

If the entire campaign is being played, the Players
use the information provided in Section 60.0 for
the initial placement and distribution of their land,
sea, and air forces, supplies and construction. If
the Players are starting the campaign with the ar-
rival of Rommel, the information in Section 61.0
is used.

[64.4] INITIATIVE

The Players determine Initiative using the infor-
mation provided in Section 60.0 or 61.0 depending
upon where they are starting their campaign. In-
iative is determined normally once the restrictions
in the appropriate section expire.

[64.5] SPECIAL RULES/ADJUSTMENTS

[64.51] There are no restrictions on normal game
actions (i.e., Raids on Rommel, the Com-
monwealth Fleet, etc. may be performed as per the
appropriate rules).

[64.52] The Axis Player’s Malta Air Availability
is determined using the appropriate campaign
game row on the Axis Strategic Airforce Commit-
ment Chart.

[64.53] If the shorter campaign game is being
played the Axis Replacement Pool must be ad-
justed as follows:

A. German Production Chart: No change.

B. Axis Truck Production Chart: The total trucks
the Axis Player may bring in are reduced to 800
Light, 2400 Medium and 500 Heavy.

C. Italian Production Chart: One-half of all
replacement points (rounding fractions up) that
could be planned up thru (i.e., including) Game-
Turn 24 are no longer available with the following
exception: the Axis Player still has 60 CV L.3 &
CV 33/35 tank replacement points available.

[64.54] If the shorter campaign game is being
played the Commonwealth Production System
must be adjusted as follows:

A. Commonwealth Truck Production Table: No
change.

B. Commonwealth Infantry Proudction Table:
No change.

C. Commonwealth Production Chart: The
replacement points listed below are reduced to (not
by) those numbers, all other replacement points
are unaffected:

Item Number
Armored Car/Armored Recce 75
Light Anti-air 70
25-pounder artillery 230
2-pounder AT guns 50
Mk VI Light tanks 5
A9 crusiers 3
AJ0 crusiers

A13 crusiers

Matildas 20

[64.6] ADR & LOGISTICS GAMES’
ABSTRACTIONS

Why anyone would play a campaign game without
the Air and/or Logistics Game(s) is beyond me.
However, the Players should pick their start point
(Italian Offensive or Desert Fox) and use the rules
in the appropriate section(s) (32.0, 47.0, 58.0) and
the abstracted set-up for that scenario group and
the replacement point adjustments in Case 64.5.

[64.7] VICTORY CONDITIONS

It would be hard to imagine anything more ex-
asperating than playing a game for five years, get-
ting to the end, and finding out that you have lost
by one point or two hexes, or something of that ilk
Victory conditions for a game of this size and
scope are almost meaningless: survival itself is a
victory. However, you have to have some sort of
objective, and the Designer has to make some sort
of decision. Our decision here is to use Victory
Conditions that compare to what actually happen-
ed, not what each side needed to do. The reason
for this is that the Axis situation was a foregone
conclusion by 1942, what with the pending Allied
invasion of Africa from the West. Thus, the Axis
had to take Alexandria (and the Delta) or else be
caught in the desert between two armies. And
Alexandria is thus the Axis objective, historically.
As for gaming, it becomes a matter of points, or
who can hold onto what.

[64.71] If the Axis Player occupies all hexes of
Alexandria and Cairo for one full Game-Turn,
and sucn occupying units can trace a line of supply
(i.e., convoy route) back to a Supply Dump which
in turn can be supplied from Tobruk or Tripoli in
any way, and that line is 90 movement points by
truck or less, the Axis wins the game—regardless
of the turn or date. Failing that, we count points,
as below.

[64.72] Starting with the first OpStage of Game-
Turn 35, if there are no Axis Combat units that can
trace a line of supply of 60 Movement Points
(Truck) to a Supply Dump and thence to Tobruk
or Tripoli as per case 64.71, game-map, the Com-
monwealth wins the game automatically. This
does not include air or coastal shipping units.

[64.73] Failing the above two cases, players
receive points for doing (or not doing) certain
things. The first of these points are Geographical
Occupation Points. The Player occupying the
given cities/villages gains the points listed. Oc-
cupation for these purposes means having a com-
bat unit of at least 1 TOE Strength in the hex. That
combat unit, at the end of the game, must have
enough Stores and Water for one Week, and
enough Fuel and Ammunition to fire its weapons
three times and move 20 CP’s. Any units failing
these ‘‘tests’’ do not occupy for victory conditons.

City/Village Axis V.P.’s C’wlth V.P.’s
Mersa.Matruh 100 10
Sidi Barrani 50 10
Siwa 20 10
Jalo 10° 20
Giarabub 15 10
Bardia 100 50
Sollum 25 - 10
Tobruk 200 100
Derna 25 50
Benghazi 75 100

[64.74] The next series of points are replacement
Victory Points. Each Player receives one point for
each unused Replacement Point allotted to him in
his Production Charts, not including planes
and/or Trucks and, for the Commonwealth
Player only, Infantry. Thus, if the Com-
monwealth Player had a total of 35 Crusader I

3/7

38

Tank Replacement Points available for the game,
but he uses only 18, he gains 17 points.

[64.75] The final type of Victory Points apply
solely to the Commonwealth Player: Withdrawal
Points. (Unit, not Drug). These apply to battalions
withdrawn from the game, other than those
Withdrawn via The Reinforcement Track. These
are voluntary withdrawals, not mandatory
withdrawals. They are earned as follows:

A. For every combat battalion (not company) or
battalion-equivalent of infantry, armour, ar-
tillery or anti-tank guns (not AA) that is at
least 75% TOE Strength that is Withdrawn
from the game the Player receives 4 point for
each week that unit is gone, to a maximum of
three points per unit. To be Withdrawn a unit
must start the Stage in Alexandria or Cairo.

B. Every time that a battalion withdrawn under
A. above is returned to the game,the Com-
monwealth Player loses two points. A unit
voluntarily Withdrawn and then returned to
the game may not be Withdrawn until six
months from the date of return. (This may
not be entirely accurate, but it will stop
players from doing the One-Point Two Step,
shuffling a single unit in and out to get one
point).

[64.76] The levels of Victory are as follows.
Again, anyone who actually finishes this game can
consider himself a winner (much as the soldier who
fights two-three years does when he survives.)
Questions about the balance of the campaign
scenario received before 1981 will be considered
with the seriousness which they deserve. The
following schedule is consulted after both sides
total their points, comparing the totals as a ratio of
most to least.

[65.0] INCONCLUSION

We have attempted, in Campaign for North
Africa, to provide the hobby with the most ac-
curate and most stimulating simulation yet under-
taken. Very little is abstracted (mostly the naval
game), and the Players are given as much to do as
we considered humanly feasible. CNA is a difficult
and complex game; it is not for the novice, to be
sure. It is our (both designer and developer) opi-
nion that we have, in the main, succeeded in our
endeavor. CNA was playtested for nearly two
years an extensive list of ‘‘veteran’’ testers, most
of whom were chosen for their insight and gaming
acumen. Many researchers were used—including
the inimitable Richard Garcyznski—more than on
any other project. The amount of work put into
the game was enormous; the amount of informa-
tion available is almost mind-boggling. We hope
that the amount of fun is just as great.

DESIGNER’S NOTES
In Brief

A game such as CNA certainly could use — nay,
demands — extensive background information as
to where and why. Unfortunately, to do this sub-
ject justice would require a veritable book. And
you already have enough to read with this game.
I’ll simply try to cover a few subjects generally.

The general research was done mostly by me; the
specifics were done by a host of others. The task
was divided into areas — Italian OB, German air,
logistics, etc. It was done over a period of two
years, and provided many hours of confusion and
some laughter. (We felt that being provided with a
complete OB for German bakery companies was a
bit much...although the temptation to use them
was great.)

The scale of the game was decided by its scope and
size — and the map configuration. The sources are
listed in the bibliography, and suffice to say the
game-maps are borrowed from several conficting
sources. Often the designer had to make difficult
decisions as to which tracks existed and which
simply filled in the blank spaces on an Italian map.
The tracks proved most difficult — I don’t think
there are two maps that agree — but defining
things-such as sand-gravel, rough, and salt marsh
was equally taxing. The map of the game is as ac-
curate as we could get it on the scale presented.
The greatest liberties, or shall we say, abstractions,
are with ridges, slopes, and escarpments. Again
the effort was, at the scale given, to present effect
rather than strict geographical accuracy.

The system itself was developed rather quickly.
The first problem tackled was the theory and ap-
plication of mobile desert warfare. Several ap-
proaches were tried, most were unsatisfactory.
What I wanted was a system that would enable
units to move as far as the player wanted them to,
but within the limits of fuel and fatigue. And I
found the germ for such an idea in an unlikely
place: Mick Uhl’s Gettysburg ’77. From that game
came the general idea for the Continual Movement
System. Actually, the system did not take full ef-
fect until I came up with the idea for Cohesion
Points — and, of course, a workable set of
numbers for such. Both of these provided the
game the one thing I wanted to prove — that
mobile units were more powerful not because they
had more ‘‘combat points’’ but because they were
more mobile.

After the movement system fell into place it took
several weeks to come up with a combat system.
The idea was to provide a tactical feel with an
operational game. (The system for CNA is
remarkably similar to Frank Chadwick’s Opera-
tion: Crusader.) Of course, the backbone for the
combat system is the OB work — and especially
the values given to each unit. Lord knows where
some of these came from, but I do know that I
have a mountain of yellow sheets in my basement
with a lot of mathematical computations. Tanks
and guns were done strictly on relative strengths —
using the Italians as a base for the lowest. The
same with infantry. I’m sure questions will arise as
to why some infantry is 2/2, some 1/2, some 1/1,
etc. A lot has to do with weaponry, some with
background and training, and some is fairly sub-
jective. The strengths themselves are not the balan-
cing factor, the Morale Level is. And Morale Level
was based on performance, training and general
esprit de corps. (The morale system was taken
from my own Veracruz, another unusual source.)

Combat, however, is not what this game is about.
Logistics is the subject, and trucks are the thesis.
And from the very beginning that is what I concen-
trated on. Most of the design work went into mak-

ing the logistics system work. Hundreds of com-
putations on breakdown rates, fuel consumption,
tonnage capacities, etc., were done using available
statistics and charts. One of the hardest jobs was
the Replacement Charts. It is one thing to deter-
mine how much a man weighs, and thus a bat-
talion; it is another to determine how much ship
space he takes up. The same can be said for guns
and other equipment. We had a fairly accurate pic-
ture of Axis shipping tonnage, but there was little
information available as to wkat was shipped on
what and how. The real problem was not coming
up with all this information, it was integrating it so
that everything meshed. Luckily, the logistics
system proved to be relatively trouble-free.

Not so for the air system, That was hell. We were
working with individual planes — a conceit of the
designer, admittedly — and thus the combat
system had to be tactical. However, this was an
operational game and I had no desire to get involv-
ed in an African version of Air War. It took a long
evening of fiddling with a calculator to come up
with the complicated series of computations that
we used to arrive at our air strengths. This was
possible only when I came up with a combat
system. If you ask me, the whole thing is a bit
much — but then you could say that of the entire
game. I would have scrapped the whole shebang
had not the playtesters enjoyed it so much. As it is,
the air system is a game within itself, with all its
logistical problems and planning. Oh, yes — hav-
ing the air commander roll for refit for each plane
individually is a good way of passing time while
the land game is on.

The main question with CNA is, “Why?” The
answer, superficially, is because that’s what the
feedback said you wanted. But that’s a cop-out. I
did CNA as a definitive and informationally over-
powering simulation because I wanted to see how
far I could take simulation gaming and still sur-
vive. CNA is virtually unplayable — as a game. It
is, for the most part, a source of information. Yet,
if it is approached from the point of view of an ex-
perience, a lesson in history, then CNA can pro-
vide remarkable insights into a fascinating cam-
paign. One does not “play” CNA, one immerses
himself in it. Some of you will, no doubt, drown;
most will just tread water. But a few of you will
find the swim refreshing.

A word as to the accuracy of all this information.
Let’s face it, I am not the definitive scholar on
North Africa — it’s not even my main area of in-
terest. There are bound to be some mistakes, some
all-too-subjective assumptions, and some pure
baloney. But all of it is based on hard research. As
I have said elsewhere, if you have better informa-
tion, use it. (And let me know, too....) This is a
system for your enjoyment; it is not an ironclad
contract between gamer and designer. One thing I
do know, from all the research we did, this —
CNA —is the first commerically available source
to publish a complete battalion-level Order of Bat-
tle for all sides at all times during Africa. Just
think how many games you can devise from that
alone!

Some brief words of thanks to those involved.
CNA took a long time (as those who ordered the
game two years ago will no doubt attest to). Along
the way many people gave freely (and not-so-
freely) of their time and energy. To Redmond
Simonsen goes the credit for coming up with the
idea for this game — and he knows how I feel
about that brainstorm. To our fearless leader, Jim
Dunnigan, a devotee of the Torquemada School of
Persuasion, goes some dubious thanks for assign-
ing me to this project. An honest vote of thanks to
my very good friend Howard Barasch, for spend-
ing many hours with his voluminous notes on the
campaign. And to my two OB researchers —

David Ryan and, especially, the incredible Richard
Garzcynski, I can only say that they saved my pro-
verbial rear-end more than once. But most of all, I
would like to thank the game’s developer, Marty
Goldberger. Marty stuck with this project through
worse than I had to do. I may have designed it, but
he had to make heads or tails of it...and he was the
one who took all the grief when we screwed up. A
remarkably dogged individual, Marty G. provided
a sense of structure and parameter that was sorely
needed. And finally, much gratitude goes to my
wife Karen, who can now stop saying, “Africa?
Are you still working on that damn game!”

BIBLIOGRAPHY FOR CNA
A Brief Note

The books and references listed here are not an ex-
tensive or complete list of all works consulted.
Some works were too general to be of use, and
while they provided interesting background you
could not say they were used as a source. Other
works are not listed simply because, in the long
delay in putting the game together, we just lost
track of the exact title (the book having been
returned to its owner, etc.) Other works, such as
the Commonwealth histories — including New
Zealand, Australian, Indian, and South African
— were definitely used but can usually be found in
any standard work on the subject. The same can be
said for the famous Playfair volumes, the four-
book work on the British effort in the Mediterra-
nean. Playfair is an incredible work, but it is flaw-
ed. It is difficult to read, having been written by
committee, as it were, and there is much informa-
tion that is missing, as well as some that is wrong.
Altogether, however, it is still the single most im-
portant source.

Finally, it must be noted that our two main OB
researchers, the estimable Messrs. Garzcynski and
Ryan, made use of a large number of unit
histories, military studies, microfilms, and private
letters and correspondence.
