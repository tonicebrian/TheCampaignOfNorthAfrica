[#3_5]
=== UNIT CHARACTERISTICS

Each counter comprises a number of TOE
Strength Points. The unit's abilities are those of
the TOE Strength Points comprising it (certain
counters may exist if there are no TOE Strength
Points in them; these possess only a Capability
Point Allowance). The following is a brief explanation of the units' characteristics:

Capability Point Allowance (abbr. CPA): The
unit's ability to execute movement and combat,
stated numerically,

Barrage Rating: A combat strength expressing the
relative capability of that unit to inflict damage
when firing as an artillery piece (i.e., indirect fire).

Vulnerability: A numerical expression of a gun's
susceptibility to being destroyed or captured when
in a Forward Position (see Case 12.1). It is based
mostly on the gun's range and tactical usage doctrine.

Anti-armor Strength: A numerical expression of a
unit's ability to destroy armored vehicles.

Armor Protection Rating: The ability of an ar-mored vehicle to withstand enemy anti-armor fire.
This is based on the vehicle's armor thickness and
excellence of construction.

Offensive Close Assault Rating: The ability, stated
numerically, of a unit to engage enemy forces in
"hand-to-hand" (i.e., Close Assault) combat.

Defensive Assault Rating: The ability, stated
numerically, of a unit to defend against a Close
Assault.

Anti-aircraft Rating: A numerical expression of a
unit's ability to shoot down aircraft (this ability
occurs, aside from anti-aircraft units, only ina few
headquarters, tanks, and other units).

Maximum TOE Strength: This is, all things considered, the most important number on the sheet
(see <<4_46>>). It is the numerical expression of
the manpower (for infantry), tank platoons (for
armored units), or batteries (for guns) in that unit.
The infantry manpower figures are based roughly
on anywhere from 100 to 200 men, depending on
the combat function of the individual and his use
within the unit. The tank platoons are calculated
in groups of five to eight vehicles. The gun batteries are calculated in groups of four guns.

Basic Morale Rating: A numerical (and somewhat
subjective) expression of a unit's training, combat
experience, and esprit d'corps, on a scale of +3
(excellent) to ""”3 (armed rabble with minimal interest in anything harmful). Certain Commonwealth units must be Trained in order to reach
their listed Basic Morale.

Fuel Rate: A simplified reduction of the vehicle's
miles per gallon efficiency.

Breakdown Adjustment Rating: An expression,
stated numerically, of the general construction
and ease of maintenance of a vehicle coupled with
the level of mechanical competence of the unit performing the maintenance.

=== GAME EQUIPMENT
CASES:

[#4_1]
=== THE GAME-MAPS

The game-map takes up a great deal of space (it is
almost ten feet in length), and it is virtually impossible to play any scenario without all the maps.
This is because of the logistical nature of the game
and the emphasis on supply lines and transport.
Players will also find that they will be using areas
of the game-map for dropping counters, piling
markers, etc. True, there are areas of the maps

that will remain virtually untouched by combat
units. Simply remember what's in play, and what
is just being used. Playtesting of CNA, which
usually took anywhere from six to 12 Players at
any given time, revealed, among other things, that
most action took place in one section of the gamemaps. It can get pretty crowded in that area at
times, so try to keep your displays and other information out of harm's way.

For those Players experiencing difficulties, the five
Map Sections are labeled A through E and are laid
long side by long side from west to east respectively (see diagram). The Map Sections should be laid
so that the Oixx hexrow of a Map Section overlays
the 39xx hexrow of the Map Section whose letter
immediately preceeds it in the alphabet (that is,
Map Section E partially overlays Map Section D
which partially overlays Map Section C, etc.).

[#4_2]
=== THE COUNTERS

There are actually few counters in play at any one
given time. However, each division on the gamemap is comprised of a large number of lesser-sized
units. These battalions and brigades might be
brought into use at any given time, so the players
should sort their counters into divisions, and
organize their divisions so that they know where
the individual units of that division are. It may
even be wise to have a separate table for placement
of such units.

[#4_25]*[4.25]* Counter Deployment

""˜A unit attached to another unit is not represented
by a counter on the game map.

For example: The First Greek Infantry Brigade
Group is comprised of the Ist Greek Brigade HQ
counter, the Ist Greek Field Artillery Regiment
counter and the Ist Greek Infantry, 2nd Greek Infantry and 3rd Greek Infantry Battalions
counters. If the three infantry battalions and the
artillery regiment were attached to the headquarters unit, the entire brigade would be
represented on the game map by the headquarters
counter. Unless specifically stated, all assigned
units beginning a scenario in the same hex as their
parent unit are attached to that parent unit. The
counters representing said units are therefore not
deployed on the game-map.

[#4_26]*[4.26]* Holding Boxes

Certain hexes on the game-map """""˜attract"""' a large
number of counters. These hexes are represented
by Holding Boxes which are nothing more than
large spaces for deploying all of the counters
which are actually located in the hex the Holding
Box is representing.

[#4_3]
=== CHARTS AND TABLES

There are an inordinate number of Charts and
Tables in CNA. Most of them can be found in the
Charts and Tables Booklet. However, some are
located on separate loose sheets of paper or
printed on the game-map or in the Rules booklets.

[#4_4]
=== ORGANIZATION
AND ARRIVAL SYSTEM

In any given scenario, the Players receive units via
the Initial Deployment (given in each scenario) and
via the Reinforcement Schedules. In addition to
these, Players may plan for Replacement Points to
augment depleted units; the discussion of these can
be found in Case 20.2. The Cases below give the
Players a base for using and understanding the terminology and location of the terms and tables for
acquiring and using units.

[#4_41]*[4.41]* There are three types of charts which the
Player will refer to in order to gain information on
his units. These are the Characteristics Charts,
which show what capabilities and characteristics
each unit or unit-type has (in terms of. ratings and
numbers), the "OA'' Sheets, which list the
organization of units and arrival dates for each
parent unit (usually division), and the Reinforcement Schedules, which list the names and dates of
all newly arriving land units. Air units have
separate reinforcement charts and tables which
determine their arrival.

[#4_42]*[4.42]* The following procedure is used to determine which units arrive during a Game-Turn and
the abilities of those arriving units. The Player
consults the appropriate Reinforcement Schedule
and determines the current Operations Stage of the
Game-Turn in progress; noting the units arriving,
he finds the OA (Organization at Arrival) Chart
for each of those units. Parent Formations are
easy to find (e.g., divisions and brigades); smaller
detachments arriving piecemeal are usually given
their parent formation for easy reference to the
correct OA Sheet. Having located the correct OA
Sheet for each unit, the Player notes the
Characteristics Code for each individual unit (that
has arrived) in that Parent, and refers to the
Characteristics Charts to determine the
capabilities of those units. Each Parent unit arrives with all lesser units listed on the OA Chart,
unless the unit has a later arrival date and/or is
listed as excluded on the Reinforcement Track.
Players should then draw up a TOE Sheet for each
such Parent Formation (and its lesser units). To
more clearly understand the above procedure,
Players should at this time run through a sample
turn of Reinforcements, using any turn on the
Track. Such a brief examination will quickly show
how this process operates.

Note: The Player is provided with an inter-locking
series of charts and tables, each dependent on the
other for information. Although there are a lot of
tables and the profusion may seem confusing, just
a brief scanning of these tables and tracks will be
enough to show how they work. Remember, each
different table or track provides a piece of information, and the tables and tracks often contain information found on the other such tracks or tables
for purposes of cross-checking. Example: The
Reinforcement Schedule shows the arrival of the
18th Australian Brigade. The Commonwealth
Player, noting that, looks forthe OA Sheet for the
18th Australian Brigade. The OA Sheet also gives
the Arrival Date, which is a cross-check with the
Reinforcement Schedule. The Player now notes
the units within the brigade, their Characteristic
Code Letters, and consults the Unit
Characteristics Charts for those units to determine
what their capabilities are. This information is
then placed on the TOE Sheet for the 18th
Brigade, along with any other information needed
or desired.

[#4_43]*[4.43]* Reinforcement Schedules
(see Charts and Tables)

[#4_44]*[4.44]* Aircraft Characteristics Charts

There are two identically organized Aircraft
Characteristics Charts ""” one for each Player.
Within each nationality the planes are grouped into those needing pilots and those not requiring
pilots. Each plane is listed individually. Certain
bear two or more rows of information. With these
planes the owning Player may freely choose which
line of characteristics and capabilities he will
assign that plane every time he readies it. The explanation of the various ratings is discussed in
Case 34.1 of the Air Game. Â°

[#4_45]*[4.45]* Organization At Arrival Charts (OA)

A great deal of time (perhaps too much time) was
spent in arriving at the most accurate Order of Battle possible. As with any major campaign, sources
differed, and the designers were forced, for a
variety of reasons, to make several decisions which
abstracted some units (especially anti-aircraft
units). We feel that CNA has, by far, the most accurate Order of Battle ever done for the Campaign
for North Africa. However, if you have information to the contrary about a specific unit, feel free
to adjust the game to fit that information. If you
feel like it, we would also like to hear about that information.

10

There are three identically organized OA Charts,
one for Allied units, one for German units, and
one for Italian units. Each chart is subdivided into
sections hereafter termed sheets. Each sheet contains game and historical information on a major
unit or grouping of units (e.g., all unassigned artillery units; 50th Infantry Division) of that
Player's forces. The sheet is laid out as follows: the
name of the major unit or regrouping is at the top.
Below that is the Basic Morale Rating for all of the
counters comprising that unit (untrained Commonwealth unit's morale at instant of arrival is indicated in parentheses where needed). This is
followed by a list of the counters comprising the
unit and any notes at the bottom of the sheet. The
counters comprising the unit are arranged with the
headquarters unit (if any) for that group at the
top. Any units assigned directly to that HQ are indented, and any unit assigned to a subsidiary unit
is further indented and listed in the rows directly
below their brigade level parent unit. The explanation of the information contained under the column headings is as follows:

Unit Name: The historical name of that unit. Certain abbreviations have been made for each nationality and they are listed at the end of the Chart.

Counter Abbreviation: The type as it appears on
the counter.

ID Code: One, two, or three letters which summarize the unit's characteristics. The unit's ratings
for a particular ID Code are listed on the Unit
Characteristics Chart for that nationality.

TOE and Weapons Systems: A unit comprised of a
single type of weapons system (i.e., TOE Strength
Points with identical cHaracteristics) bears an
N(ormal), U(nderstrength), or. O(verstrength) indicator. If the unit is normal, it arrives (or begins
deployed) at its maximum possible TOE Strength.
If the unit arrives understrength or overstrength its
TOE Strength at arrival will follow the U or O. If,
on arrival, a unit comprises tank, artillery, or antitank TOE Strength Points, the number and then
the type of the different TOE Strength Points will
be listed.'

Arrives: The Operation Stage/Game-Turn on
which the unit arrives. If the unit beings the first
scenario already deployed on the map, it is noted
as a D. This column is a check on the Reinforcement Schedule.

The OA Sheets are needed for a purpose other
than pure numerical information. The OA Sheets
list the units originally assigned to a Parent unit.
This is important, as units assigned to a Parent
unit may stack and unstack, attach and detach
themselves quite freely compared to other units being attached to that same Parent unit. The OA
Sheets also, on occasion, list units that were
historically attached to a Parent Formation at certain times during the Campaign.

There are numerous units that are not assigned toa
division. These may be brigades (the Commonwealth Player has many of these) or simply
solitary battalions, artillery regiments, etc. These
units are grouped on OA Sheets according to their
most important assignment characteristics (i.e., all
of the British unassigned anti-air units are on a
single OA Sheet).

The designers of CNA have chosen the division/brigade/battalion terminology system
because it was (1) the basic system of a majority of
the units in the campaign, and (2) the system with
which they were most familiar. In many places it
does not reflect the actual organizational levels of
a unit. This is further exacerbated by the maddening British desire to calleverything a regiment or a
brigade when, in fact, it is a battalion. Thus, the
7th Rifle Brigade is, in game terms, a battalion (actually the 7th Battalion, the Rifle Brigade) and

most of the "Tank Regiments"""' are battalion-size
units. Most Players familiar with the campaign
should have little trouble with items such as these
(few people will think that the 1st King's Royal Rifle Corps is, in fact, an actual Corps).

(4.46] Unit Characteristics Charts

There are three identically organized Unit
Characteristics charts, one for Allied units, one
for German units and one for Italian units. The
Unit Characteristics Chart lists each ID Code's
maximum TOE Strength Points and its values for
the various Ratings. Unless otherwise indicated on
the chart, all tank, artillery, anti-tank, and certain
HQ units may comprise any combination of the
variety of the weapons systems listed. These units
take on the characteristics of the assigned TOE
Strength Points (weapons systems). A unit comprising multiple weapons systems is a single unit
for all purposes. However, all actions are undertaken using the ratings of the individual TOE
Strength Points (e.g., an artillery unit comprising
two TOE Strength Points of eighteen pounder
guns and four TOE Strength Points of twenty-five
pounder guns engaging in Barrage will fire at two
times the eighteen pounder gun Barrage Rating
plus four times the twenty-five pounder gun Barrage Rating). Note that a unit comprising different
TOE Strength Points normally possess a CPA of
that of the slowest TOE Strength Point. The
characteristics of the individiual weapons systems
are listed on the appropriate nationality's Tank
and Gun Characteristics' Chart. Certain unit
posses parenthesized combat ratings. These units
are discussed in Case 3.4. Certain headquarters
units' maximum limit in assigned TOE Strength
Points are enclosed in parentheses. Any weapons
system TOE Strength Points assigned to such a
unit operate with parenthesized combat values.
Players should note that the maximum number of
assigned TOE Strength Points for British Tank
Regiments (battalion-equivalents) changes slightly
in early 1942, with the influx of the first American
tanks. Tank regiments with only American tanks
(Grants and/or Shermans and/or Stuarts) now
have a maximum of 9 TOE Strength Points, not
ten. The reason for this decision is not clear; the
allotment of tanks to a regiment, however, was
dropped from 52 to 44 when the tanks were
American. This was readjusted later on.

=== LOG SHEETS

Because of the enormous amount of information
provided with CNA, and because of the game
system devised for its use, there are a great number
of Play-aids, in the form of Informational Sheets.
The playing counters themselves have little combat
information other than the unit designations and
Stacking Points, and there are few "tracks'' by
which the Players can keep visual record of
various supply levels. The reasons for this are
many: the desire of the designer to include as much
information as possible; the problem of keeping
vital information secret from other Players; the
fact that the game-map itself is so large that having
a plethora of charts and tracks would make it
necessary to rent The Hearst Estate at San Simeon

to play it, etc. Therefore, players will keep track of
virtually all the information they need ""” which is
quite extensive ""” on the various sheets. The
following sections describe these sheets, although
we hope that they have been so designed that their
utilization becomes self-evident. Players should
feel free to devise any other sheets or methods they
feel necessary to ease the flow of the game; most of
the sheets in CNA were "designed'' by the playtesters.

One copy of each type of Log Sheet is provided
with CNA. Players should therefore produce as
many copies of each form as they need, The
designers suggest you use pencils and write lightly
to make complete erasures easy.

[#4_51]*[4.51]* The Log Sheets have been divided into four
groups on the basis of their ""˜owning' Player's
usage. This is simply a presentation decision and
has no effect on who actually uses what in a game.

[#4_52]*[4.52]* Field Commander's Group

These forms are used by the Players in charge of
frontline fighting combat units.

Field Commander Control Sheet: This is designed
to help the Field Commander coordinate his
forces. Each row on the sheet is meant for each
counter on the game-map under the Player's control. These counters will normally be Division-Eq,
and a few Brigade-Eq's. Space is provided for
keeping track of the unit's Capability Point expenditure(s) in that Operations Stage, its Capability
Point Allowance (CPA), current Cohesion Level,
Actual Points the unit could contribute to a Barrage and Offensive and Defensive Close Assault,
and its reserves of Ammo and Fuel. There is space
for your "weekly'' Stores requirements for the
units as a whole (Players rarely transport Stores on
Attached Trucks, because the Stores are required
only once per game-week). The bottom section of
the sheet is for notes, normally detailing
peculiarities of certain of the units attached to the
counters listed above them on the sheet.

TOE Log Sheets: There are three of these in order
to ease handling five basic division formation and
organization structures and counters representing
Brigade-Eq and smaller units. The TOE Log
Sheets are the equivalent, for play purposes, of a
giant combat unit counter. Each Parent Unit
possesses its own TOE Log Sheet, and on it the
Players keep track of the various strengths and
ratings of the units within that formation, the
changes to them and the supplies and trucks carried by and attached to that unit. The sheets can all
be divided into the following sections or information areas:

A. Counter Identity: This is the area on the top
of the sheet. The counter's historical name, its
Basic Morale, its Current Morale (if 'Commonwealth), and any other useful information (such as
its assigned Parent Unit, if any, Garrison location,
engineering capability, etc.) should be written in
this section.

E. Logistics: This is the area marked "1st Line
Transport.'' The area is sub-divided into Trucks
Available and Supplies. The first grouping consists of two paired rows of three boxes. They are
for indicating the total attached Trucks and of
those trucks, which are currently transporting
nothing, by division into Heavy, Medium and
Light trucks. The second grouping is for supplies
and troops and/or guns being motorized by the attached trucks by the amount and the number of
trucks and the type that are carrying them.

F. Combat Information: Boxes for recording
(usually the maximum) number of actual Points
that the unit is capable of in each of the categories.

D. Augmentation: This is for recording the
attachment of units over that formation's
